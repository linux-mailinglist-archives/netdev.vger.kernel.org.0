Hello Dear,

Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments as I know
that this letter may come to you as big surprise. Actually, I came
across your E-mail from my personal search afterward I decided to
email you directly believing that you will be honest to fulfill my
final wish
before or after my death.

Meanwhile, I am Mrs Hisham Latifa, 73 years, from France, childless and
a widow. I am suffering from Adenocarcinoma Cancer of the lungs for
the last 8 years and from all indication my condition is really
deteriorating as my doctors have confirmed and courageously advised me
that I may not live beyond 6 weeks from now for the reason that my
tumor has reached a critical stage which has defiled all forms of
medical treatment.

Since my days are numbered, I=E2=80=99ve decided willingly to fulfill my
long-time vow to donate to the underprivileged the sum of Eighteen
million five hundred thousand dollars. (18,500,000.00 USD) I have
tried to exercise this project by myself but I have seen that my
health could not allow me to do so anymore. My promise for the poor
includes building of well-equipped charity foundation hospital and a
technical school.

If you will be honest, kind, humble and willing to assist me exercise
this function as I=E2=80=99ve mentioned here, I will like you to provide me
your personal data like,

(1) Your full name:

(2) country:

(3) phone number:

(4) Age:

Pray for me if you love humanity

Best Regards!

Mrs Hisham Latifa
