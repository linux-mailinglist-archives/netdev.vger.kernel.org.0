Subject: [RFC net-next 2/2] dt-bindings: ethernet-phy: define `unsupported-mac-connection-types` property

An ethernet PHY may support PHY interface modes that are not wired on a
specific board (or are broken for some other reason). In order for the
kernel to know that these modes should not be used, we need to specify
this in device tree.

Define a new ethernet PHY property `unsupported-mac-connection-types`,
which lists these unsupported modes.

As in the previous patch: we allow both `phy-connection-type` and
`phy-mode` to define PHY interface mode. Should we call this new
property as it is proposed by this patch, or something different,
like `unsupported-mac-phy-modes`?

Also, some PHYs (marvell10g for example) also multiple units (host
unit for connecting to the MAC, fiber unit for connecting for example
via a SFP). Should we also add `unsupported-fiber-connection-types`
property?

Moreover should this property be a member of PHY's node, or the
ethernet controller's node? Were it a member of ethernet controller's
node, we wouldn't need to $ref a definition from another file's $defs
(which Rob Herring says that so far is done only in withing single
file).
On the other hand `unsupported-fiber-connection-types` property should
be a member of PHY's node, if we will add this in the future.
