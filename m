Ah, right. I got your point now, you don't want the user to see
half-init devlink objects. In reload, the secondhalf-uninit&seconfhalf-init
happens atomically under instance lock, so the user sees the whole picture
still.

But is it a problem? For ports, I don't think so. For the other objects
being removed-readded during reload, why do you think it is a problem?
