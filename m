A lot of them are, and many could be, though not all.

Seems reasonable to me.

I guess I don't see that happening :)

Oh, I didn't mean to imply it should truncate or panic or such - but if
it returns a pointer it can still be an ERR_PTR() or NULL instead of
having this separate indication, which even often confuses static type
checkers since they don't always see the "errno == 0 <=> ptr != NULL"
relation.

So not saying you shouldn't have any error return - clearly you need
that, just saying that I'm not sure that having the two separated is
great.

Yeah, dunno, I guess I'm slightly more on the side of not requiring it,
since we don't do the same for kmalloc() etc. and probably really
wouldn't want to add kmalloc_s() that does it ;-)

I mean, you _could_ go there:

int kmalloc_s(void **ptr, size_t size, gfp_t gfp)
{
  void *ret;

  if (*ptr)
    return -EINVAL;

  ret = kmalloc(size, gfp);
  if (!ret)
    return -ENOMEM;
  *ptr = ret;
  return 0;  
}

right? But we don't really do that, and I'm not sure it'd be a win if
done over the whole code base.

So I'm not really sure why this aspect here should need to be different,
except of course that you already need the input argument for the magic.

But we could still have (this prototype is theoretical, of course, it
cannot be implemented in C):

void *mem_to_flex_dup(void *ptr, const void *data, size_t elements,
                      gfp_t gfp);


which isn't really that much better though.

And btw, while I was writing it down I was looking to see if it should
be "size_t elements" or "size_t len" (like memcpy), it took me some time
to figure out, and I was looking at the examples:

 1) most of them actually use __u8 or some variant thereof, so you
    couldÂ probably add an even simpler macro like
       BOUNDED_FLEX_DATA(int, bytes, data)
    which has the u8 type internally.

 2) Unless I'm confusing myself, you got the firewire change wrong,
    because __mem_to_flex_dup takes the "elements_count", but the
    memcpy() there wasn't multiplied by the sizeof(element)? Or maybe
    the fact that it was declared as __u32 header[0] is wrong, and it
    should be __u8, but it's all very confusing, and I'm really not
    sure about this at all.



One "perhaps you'll laugh me out of the room" suggestion might be to
actually be able to initialize the whole thing too?


mydata = flex_struct_alloc(mydata, GFP_KERNEL,
                           variable_data, variable_len,
                           .member = 1,
                           .another = 2);

(the ordering can't really be otherwise since you have to use
__VA_ARGS__).

That might reduce some more code too, though I guess it's quite some
additional magic ... :)

I was going to point to struct cfg80211_bss_ies, but I realize now
they're RCU-managed, so we never resize them anyway ... So maybe it's
less common than I thought it might be.

I suppose you know better since you converted a lot of stuff already :-)
