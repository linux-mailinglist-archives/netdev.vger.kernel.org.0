Why is that the case? Why can't both the MAC and the PHY request a 
unique
name from the same namespace? As Andrew pointed out, the names in
/sys/class/leds don't really matter. Ok, it will still depend on the
probe order which might not be the case if you split it between ethmac
and ethphy.

Sorry, if I may ask stupid questions here. I don't want to cause much
trouble, here. I was just wondering why we have to make up two different
(totally unrelated names to the network interface names) instead of just
one (again totally unrelated to the interface name and index).

Oh, I see. I was assuming we are talking about "just a number" not
related to anything.

Yes, in my case ethernet0 has nothing to do with eth0, either.

But I was actually referring to your "you see the leds in /sys/ of all
the network adapters". That problem still persists, right?
