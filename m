Subject: [PATCH net-next v3 0/5] Support for RollBall 10G copper SFP modules

Hello,

this is v3 of series adding support for RollBall/Hilink SFP modules.

Checked with:
  checkpatch.pl --max-line-length=80

Changes from v2:
- added comment into the patch adding support for RollBall I2C MDIO
  protocol, saying that we expect the SFP_PAGE not to be changed by
  the SFP code, as requested by Russell. If, in the future, SFP code
  starts modifying SFP_PAGE, we will have to handle it in mdio-i2c
  somehow
- destruction of I2C MDIO bus in patch 3/5 now depends on whether the
  MDIO bus is not NULL, instead of whether PHY exists, as suggested by
  Russell
- changed waiting time for RollBall module to initialize from 30 seconds
  to 25 seconds. Testing shows that it is never longer than 21-22
  seconds, so waiting 25 seconds instead of 30 is IMO safe enough
- added Russell's Reviewed-by tags where relevant

Changes from v1:
- wrapped to 80 columns as per Russell's request
- initialization of RollBall MDIO I2C protocol moved from sfp.c to
  mdio-i2c.c as per Russell's request
- second patch removes the 802.3z check also from phylink_sfp_config
  as suggested by Russell
- creation/destruction of mdiobus for SFP now occurs before probing
  for PHY/after releasing PHY (as suggested by Russell)
- the last patch became a little simpler after the above was done
