Yes, I have already some WIP code and I'm planning to send a pull
request to pppd on github for it. I guess that it could be accepted,
specially if there still would be backward compatibility via ioctl for
kernels which do not support rtnl API. One of the argument which can be
used why rtnl API is better, is fixing issue: atomic creating of
interface with specific name.

But pppd is maintained by Paul (already in loop), so I hope we could
hear some feedback.
