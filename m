Yeah, I understand what you are saying, I also didn't like the idea of
having TXTIME knowledge inside taprio. This trade off was made because
the HW we have is very... particular about the launchtime, if the
launchtime for a packet ends after the "close" time for that queue, that
queue can end up stuck (for multiple seconds in some extreme cases).

The idea is that other vendors could be as particular.

Also, what helped convince me was that txtime is a feature of the
socket/skb, and if taprio/whatever can use it to make the driver life's
easier, then let's use it, that is

Even if offloaded ETF will re-order packets. In bit more detail, ETF
will re-order packets if their launchtime is more than "delta"
nanoseconds in the future.

I don't think you are missing anything.

Just some background, ETF was written thinking mostly about it being
offloaded, the non-offloaded/"software" mode was a best-effort
implementation of that idea.

That is, If you have use cases for non-offloaded ETF and it work better
if it didn't drop "late" packets, I would be happy hear more.
