Since I measure the third operation only this shouldn't affect recreation
of the configuration file.

I tried to explain why my methodology is closer to what we need to measure
in the above and replies. TL;DR: mathematically the O() shadows o() and as
we know the CPU and disk usage during compilation is a huge in comparison
to the C preprocessing. I'm not sure what you are referring by "slower
over time" since I explicitly said that I have _sorted_ the data. Nothing
should be done here, I believe.

I believe you missed the very same remark, i.e. that the data is sorted.

Because that machine has more processes being run. And I would like to
minimize fluctuation of the CPU scheduling when some process requires
a resource to perform little work.

How -j64 can be better? Nothing will guarantee that any of the core will
be half-loaded. But -j88 is worse because any process that wakes up and
requires for a resource may affect the measurements.

Next time I will try this approach, thanks for your reply and insights!
