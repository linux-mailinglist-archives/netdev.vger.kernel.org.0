I had a look and it seems that is a different issue here, but I cannot
exclude that this is related.

First the link up/down, negotiation and mdio and related communication
is perfectly fine, what it looks like is not working is that no data is
flowing over RGMII.

Second, also in our case the clock is coming from the SoC, however this
clock is enabled way earlier in the boot, and at that time the phy is
even in reset.

 phy reset asserted
 . SPL on TI AM62 R5
   . enable clock
 . SPL on TI AM62 A
 . U-Boot proper on TI AM62 A
   .release phy reset

The phy reset is also configured in the DTS and used by the Linux driver.

In addition to that, as I already clarified in my second email, the
issue is happening also on a cold poweron. It happens most of the time,
but not always.

Francesco
