While I totally agree on the background idea, I don't really see how
this is possible. Every driver internally knows what it supports but
AFAIU the core itself has no easy and standard access to it?

Another question that I have: is the protocol and center frequency
enough to always derive the symbol rate? I am not sure this is correct,
but I thought not all symbol rates could be derived, like for example
certain UWB PHY protocols which can use different PRF on a single
channel which has an effect on the symbol duration?

Right, I just have a patch aside setting this to enforce beacons
checksum were good. I can certainly set this flag officially.
