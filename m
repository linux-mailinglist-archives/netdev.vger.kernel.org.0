	This patchset impelements support of SOCK_SEQPACKET for virtio
transport.
	As SOCK_SEQPACKET guarantees to save record boundaries, so to
do it, two new packet operations were added: first for start of record
 and second to mark end of record(SEQ_BEGIN and SEQ_END later). Also,
both operations carries metadata - to maintain boundaries and payload
integrity. Metadata is introduced by adding special header with two
fields - message count and message length:

	struct virtio_vsock_seq_hdr {
		__le32  msg_cnt;
		__le32  msg_len;
	} __attribute__((packed));

	This header is transmitted as payload of SEQ_BEGIN and SEQ_END
packets(buffer of second virtio descriptor in chain) in the same way as
data transmitted in RW packets. Payload was chosen as buffer for this
header to avoid touching first virtio buffer which carries header of
packet, because someone could check that size of this buffer is equal
to size of packet header. To send record, packet with start marker is
sent first(it's header contains length of record and counter), then
counter is incremented and all data is sent as usual 'RW' packets and
finally SEQ_END is sent(it also carries counter of message, which is
counter of SEQ_BEGIN + 1), also after sedning SEQ_END counter is
incremented again. On receiver's side, length of record is known from
packet with start record marker. To check that no packets were dropped
by transport, counters of two sequential SEQ_BEGIN and SEQ_END are
checked(counter of SEQ_END must be bigger that counter of SEQ_BEGIN by
1) and length of data between two markers is compared to length in
SEQ_BEGIN header.
	Now as  packets of one socket are not reordered neither on
vsock nor on vhost transport layers, such markers allows to restore
original record on receiver's side. If user's buffer is smaller that
record length, when all out of size data is dropped.
	Maximum length of datagram is not limited as in stream socket,
because same credit logic is used. Difference with stream socket is
that user is not woken up until whole record is received or error
occurred. Implementation also supports 'MSG_EOR' and 'MSG_TRUNC' flags.
	Tests also implemented.

 v4 -> v5:
 - patches reorganized:
   1) Setting of packet's type in 'virtio_transport_send_pkt_info()'
      is moved to separate patch.
   2) Simplifying of 'virtio_transport_send_credit_update()' is
      moved to separate patch and before main virtio/vsock patches.
 - style problem fixed
 - in 'af_vsock: separate receive data loop' extra 'release_sock()'
   removed
 - added trace event fields for SEQPACKET
 - in 'af_vsock: separate wait data loop':
   1) 'vsock_wait_data()' removed 'goto out;'
   2) Comment for invalid data amount is changed.
 - in 'af_vsock: rest of SEQPACKET support', 'new_transport' pointer
   check is moved after 'try_module_get()'
 - in 'af_vsock: update comments for stream sockets', 'connect-oriented'
   replaced with 'connection-oriented'
 - in 'loopback/vsock: setup SEQPACKET ops for transport',
   'loopback/vsock' replaced with 'vsock/loopback'

 v3 -> v4:
 - SEQPACKET specific metadata moved from packet header to payload
   and called 'virtio_vsock_seq_hdr'
 - record integrity check:
   1) SEQ_END operation was added, which marks end of record.
   2) Both SEQ_BEGIN and SEQ_END carries counter which is incremented
      on every marker send.
 - af_vsock.c: socket operations for STREAM and SEQPACKET call same
   functions instead of having own "gates" differs only by names:
   'vsock_seqpacket/stream_getsockopt()' now replaced with
   'vsock_connectible_getsockopt()'.
 - af_vsock.c: 'seqpacket_dequeue' callback returns error and flag that
   record ready. There is no need to return number of copied bytes,
   because case when record received successfully is checked at virtio
   transport layer, when SEQ_END is processed. Also user doesn't need
   number of copied bytes, because 'recv()' from SEQPACKET could return
   error, length of users's buffer or length of whole record(both are
   known in af_vsock.c).
 - af_vsock.c: both wait loops in af_vsock.c(for data and space) moved
   to separate functions because now both called from several places.
 - af_vsock.c: 'vsock_assign_transport()' checks that 'new_transport'
   pointer is not NULL and returns 'ESOCKTNOSUPPORT' instead of 'ENODEV'
   if failed to use transport.
 - tools/testing/vsock/vsock_test.c: rename tests

 v2 -> v3:
 - patches reorganized: split for prepare and implementation patches
 - local variables are declared in "Reverse Christmas tree" manner
 - virtio_transport_common.c: valid leXX_to_cpu() for vsock header
   fields access
 - af_vsock.c: 'vsock_connectible_*sockopt()' added as shared code
   between stream and seqpacket sockets.
 - af_vsock.c: loops in '__vsock_*_recvmsg()' refactored.
 - af_vsock.c: 'vsock_wait_data()' refactored.

 v1 -> v2:
 - patches reordered: af_vsock.c related changes now before virtio vsock
 - patches reorganized: more small patches, where +/- are not mixed
 - tests for SOCK_SEQPACKET added
 - all commit messages updated
 - af_vsock.c: 'vsock_pre_recv_check()' inlined to
   'vsock_connectible_recvmsg()'
 - af_vsock.c: 'vsock_assign_transport()' returns ENODEV if transport
   was not found
 - virtio_transport_common.c: transport callback for seqpacket dequeue
 - virtio_transport_common.c: simplified
   'virtio_transport_recv_connected()'
 - virtio_transport_common.c: send reset on socket and packet type
			      mismatch.
