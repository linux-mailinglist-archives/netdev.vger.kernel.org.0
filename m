Dear friend how are you today?
I know you will be surprise to receive this message from me because;
we have not met before but please listen to me very well. I am writing
you this mail from a Hospital. My name is Mrs. Anna Mustafa. I am a
widow and very sick now. I am suffering from Endometrial Cancer which
my doctor has confirmed that I will not survive it because of some
damages. Now because of the condition of my health I have decided to
donate out my late husband fund the sum  of $3, 500,000.00 on Charity
Purpose through your  help. All you have to do is to use the money in
the following ways.

(1) To build school for the poor children.
(2) To help the Orphanages, Sick People, and Poor Widows etc. If you
agree to help me, I will instruct the bank to proceed and transfer the
money to your account to enable you start this project on my behalf
since I am very sick now and cannot do this work by myself.

Lastly, after the transfer of the money to your account, I permit you
to take out 30% of the money for your recompense in doing this work. I
don=E2=80=99t have a child or any available relative who can inherit this
money when I die. I wil tell you more about myself and how to proceed
forward on this transaction.
God bless you.
Mrs. Anna
