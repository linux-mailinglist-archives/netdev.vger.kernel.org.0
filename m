we had been experiencing memory leaks on v4.19.37, thats why we started to turn on
KASAN and kmemleak in the first place. This is when we found this use-after-free.

The memory leak exists, and is a separate issue. Apparently kmemleak does not work,
I suspect the early log size is too small

root@gw02:~# echo scan > /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak                                                                                                                                                                                 -bash: echo: write error: Device or resource busy

CONFIG_HAVE_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_EARLY_LOG_SIZE=400
# CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_TEST is not set
# CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_DEFAULT_OFF is not set
CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_AUTO_SCAN=y

I'll increase the early log size with the next build to try and get more information
on the memory leak, I'll open a separate thread for that then.

Thanks,
  Martin
