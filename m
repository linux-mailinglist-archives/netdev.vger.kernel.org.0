Jakub, it is not only about installation dependencies, the issue is
more critical than this, 

We had some other issues with similar dependency problem where
mlx5_core had hard dependency with netfilter, firewalld when disabled,
removes netfilter and all its dependencies including mlx5, this is a no
go for our users.

Again, having a hard dependency between a hardware driver and a
peripheral module in the kernel is a bad design.
