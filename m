+============================
+Intel Ethernet Common Module
+============================
+
+The Intel Ethernet Common Module is meant to serve as an abstraction layer
+between device specific implementation details and common net device driver
+flows. This library provides several function hooks which allow a device driver
+to specify register addresses, control queue communications, and other device
+specific functionality.  Some functions are required to be implemented while
+others have a default implementation that is used when none is supplied by the
+device driver.  Doing this, a device driver can be written to take advantage
+of existing code while also giving the flexibility to implement device specific
+features.
+
+The common use case for this library is for a network device driver that wants
+to specify its own device specific details but also leverage the more common
+code flows found in network device drivers.
+
+Sections in this document:
+	Entry Point
+	Exit Point
+	Register Operations API
+	Virtchnl Operations API
+
+Entry Point
+~~~~~~~~~~~
+The primary entry point to the library is the iecm_probe function.  Prior to
+calling this, device drivers must have allocated an iecm_adapter struct and
+initialized it with the required API functions.  The adapter struct, along with
+the pci_dev struct and the pci_device_id struct, is provided to iecm_probe
+which finalizes device initialization and prepares the device for open.
+
+The iecm_dev_ops struct within the iecm_adapter struct is the primary vehicle
+for passing information from device drivers to the common module.  A dependent
+module must define and assign a reg_ops_init function which will assign the
+respective function pointers to initialize register values (see iecm_reg_ops
+struct).  These are required to be provided by the dependent device driver as
+no suitable default can be assumed for register addresses.
+
+The vc_ops_init function pointer and the related iecm_virtchnl_ops struct are
+optional and should only be necessary for device drivers which use a different
+method/timing for communicating across a mailbox to the hardware.  Within iecm
+is a default interface provided in the case where one is not provided by the
+device driver.
+
+Exit Point
+~~~~~~~~~~
+When the device driver is being prepared to be removed through the pci_driver
+remove callback, it is required for the device driver to call iecm_remove with
+the pci_dev struct provided.  This is required to ensure all resources are
+properly freed and returned to the operating system.
+
+Register Operations API
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+iecm_reg_ops contains three different function pointers relating to initializing
+registers for the specific net device using the library.
+
+ctlq_reg_init relates specifically to setting up registers related to control
+queue/mailbox communications.  Registers that should be defined include: head,
+tail, len, bah, bal, len_mask, len_ena_mask, and head_mask.
+
+vportq_reg_init relates to setting up queue registers.  The tail registers to
+be assigned to the iecm_queue struct for each RX/TX queue.
+
+intr_reg_init relates to any registers needed to setup interrupts.  These
+include registers needed to enable the interrupt and change ITR settings.
+
+If the initialization function finds that one or more required function
+pointers were not provided, an error will be issued and the device will be
+inoperable.
+
+
+Virtchnl Operations API
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+The virtchnl is a conduit between driver and hardware that allows device
+drivers to send and receive control messages to/from hardware.  This is
+optional to be specified as there is a general interface that can be assumed
+when using this library.  However, if a device deviates in some way to
+communicate across the mailbox correctly, this interface is provided to allow
+that.
+
+If vc_ops_init is set in the dev_ops field of the iecm_adapter struct, then it
+is assumed the device driver is providing its own interface to do virtchnl
+communications.  While providing vc_ops_init is optional, if it is provided, it
+is required that the device driver provide function pointers for those functions
+in vc_ops, with exception for the enable_vport, disable_vport, and destroy_vport
+functions which may not be required for all devices.
+
+If the initialization function finds that vc_ops_init was defined but one or
+more required function pointers were not provided, an error will be issued and
+the device will be inoperable.
