Good Day,


I know this email might come to you as a surprise as first coming from
one you haven=E2=80=99t met with before.

I am Mr. Omra Musa, the bank manager with ADB bank of Burkina Faso,and
a personal banker of Dr.Mohamed Farouk Ibrahim, an Egyptian who
happened to be a medical contractor attached to the overthrown Afghan
government by the Taliban government.

Dr.Mohamed Farouk Ibrahim deposits some sum of ($15) million USD with
our bank but he was died by car accidents with his family while trying
to leave from Kandahar.

The said sum can be used for an investment if you are interested.
Details relating to the funds are in my position and will present you
as the Next-of-Kin because there was none, and I shall furnish you
with more detail once i hear your response.

Regards,
Mr. Omra Musa
