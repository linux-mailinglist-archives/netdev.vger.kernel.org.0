I think it is totally acceptable.

The same strategy is used in NIC drivers, before recycling a page.

If page_is_pfmemalloc() returns true, they simply release the 'problematic'page
and attempt a new allocation.

( git grep -n page_is_pfmemalloc -- drivers/net/ethernet/ )

I think your proposal is fine, thanks !
