	Yes. It seems we can not create new connection in
all cases, we should also check with is_new_conn().

	What we have is that two cases are possible depending on 
conn_reuse_mode, the state of existing connection and whether
netfilter conntrack is used:

	1. setup expire for old conn, then drop packet
	2. setup expire for old conn, then create new
	conn to schedule the packet

	When expiration is set, the timer will fire in the
next jiffie to remove the connection from hash table. Until
removed, the connection still can cause drops. Sometimes
we can simply create new connection with the same tuple,
so it is possible both connections to coexist for one jiffie
but the old connection is not reached on lookup.

	Yes, we drop while old conn is not expired yet

	Yes, OPS is not affected.

	Yes, the existing template is ignored when its server
is unavailable.

	The change will allow immediate scheduling in a new
connection for any protocol when netfilter conntrack is not
used:

- TCP: avoids retransmission for SYN
- UDP: reduces drops from 1 jiffie to 0 (no drops)

	But this single jiffie compared to the delay between
real server failure and the removal from the IPVS table can be
negligible. Of course, if real server is removed while it is
working, with this change we should not see any UDP drops.

	Such flushing can help when conntrack is used in which
case the cost is a retransmission or downtime for one jiffie.

	Yes, if the packet is SYN we can create new connection.
If it is ACK, the retransmission will get RST.
