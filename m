Yea, I think we need to extend the plumbing of resources to allow
specifying or assigning parent resources to a subfunction.

I don't think port parameters make sense here. They only encapsulate
single name -> value pairs, and don't really help show the relationships
between the subfunction ports and the parent device.

I've been looking into queue management and being able to add and remove
queue groups and queues. I'm leaning towards building on top of devlink
resource for this.

Specifically I have been looking at picking up the work started by
Magnus last year, around creating interface for representing queues to
the stack better for AF_XDP, but it also has other possible uses.

I'd like to make sure it aligns with the ideas here for partitioning
resources. It seems like that should be best done at the devlink level,
where the main devlink instance knows about all the part limitations and
can then have new commands for allowing assignment of resources to ports.
