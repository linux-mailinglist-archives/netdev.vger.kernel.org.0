Yes, there are alternative ways, as RNR caused by the missmatch of send rate and receive rate, which means sending too fast
or receiving too slow. What I have done in this patch is to backpressure the sending side when sending too fast.

Another solution is to process and refill the receive queue as quickly as posibble, which requires no protocol-level change. 
The fllowing modifications are needed:
- Enqueue cdc msgs to backlog queues instead of processing in rx tasklet. llc msgs remain unchanged.
- A mempool is needed as cdc msgs are processed asynchronously. Allocate new receive buffers from mempool when refill receive queue.
- Schedule backlog queues to other cpus, which are calculated by 4-tuple or 5-tuple hash of the connections, to process the cdc msgs,
  in order to reduce the usage of the cpu where rx tasklet runs on.

the pseudocode shows below:
rx_tasklet
    if cdc_msgs
        enqueue to backlog;
	maybe smp_call_function_single_async is needed to wakeup the corresponding cpu to process backlog;
        allocate new buffer and modify the sge in rq_wr;
    else
        process remains unchanged;
    endif

    post_recv rq_wr;
end rx_tasklet

smp_backlog_process in corresponding cpu, called by smp_call_function_single_async
    for connections hashed to this cpu
        for cdc_msgs in backlog
            process cdc msgs;
        end cdc_msgs
    end connections
end smp_backlog_process

Iâ€˜d like to hear your suggestions of this solution.
Thank you.
