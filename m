The current behavior is:
If queue_pages_range() return -EIO (vma is not migratable, ignore other 
conditions since we just focus on page migration), the policy won't be 
set and no page will be migrated.

However, the problem here is the vma might look migratable, but some or 
all the underlying pages are unmovable. So, my patch assumes the vma is 
*not* migratable if at least one page is unmovable. I'm not sure if it 
is possible to have both movable and unmovable pages for the same 
mapping or not, I'm supposed the vma would be split much earlier.

If we don't abort immediately, then we record if there is unmovable 
page, then we could do:
#1. Still follows the current behavior (then why not abort immediately?)
#2. Set mempolicy then migrate all the migratable pages. But, we may end 
up with the pages on node A, but the policy says node B. Doesn't it 
break the policy?
