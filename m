once there's NVMEM wired in of_get_mac_address, one can simply use it, nothing
is going to stop the potential user of doing so and if EPROBE_DEFER isn't
propagated from the driver back to the upper device driver subsytem, it's
probably going to end with random MAC address in some (very rare?) cases.

So if we don't want to properly convert all current of_get_mac_address users,
and just selectively upgrade drivers which could support NVMEM (and it makes
sense for those drivers) with proper EPROBE_DEFER handling, we should probably
just extend of_get_mac_address and convert those drivers to NVMEM one by one,
as needed:

 enum of_mac_addr {
	OF_MAC_ADDR_DT = 0,
	OF_MAC_ADDR_DT_NVMEM
 };

 const void *of_get_mac_address(struct device_node *np, enum of_mac_addr type);

  (just my first rough idea, feel free to suggest something more acceptable)

I've read the code in that macb driver several times and I don't see any code
which is specificaly handling the EPROBE_DEFER, so I'm probably blind or I miss
something fundamental ;-) This driver is simply forwarding that EPROBE_DEFER
error to the upper layer, nothing specific. The other one, davinci_emac simply
doesn't care about the possible EPROBE_DEFER and uses random MAC address in
case of any NVMEM error.

Thanks for the hint, I've created of_has_nvmem_mac_addr helper for that and it
works fine.

While looking at all current of_get_mac_address users, I've simply found out,
that it would look inconsistent and confusing to propagate back EPROBE_DEFER
just in some places, so I've bitten the bullet and converted all current
of_get_mac_address users to return EPROBE_DEFER properly (where applicable),
see bellow.

It has resulted in a bunch of commits, and as I'm not sure how it's going to be
received and to avoid sending more nonsense to a lot of lists and people, I've
made it available in my GitHub repository (just tell me that it's OK and I'll
send it as v3):

So I'm wondering, is this (probably) proper handling of EPROBE_DEFER overkill?

Or should I really just convert all current consumers of of_get_mac_address to
IS_ERR_OR_NULL() macro check (as you've suggested) and call it a day? 

Or should I simply change of_get_mac_address so it would allow for progressive
conversion of drivers using of_get_mac_address to NVMEM?

Thanks!
