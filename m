We don't have inflight IOs with DPDK Vhsot library for net devices.
But yes, a solution is to have a tmpfs file to save needed data.

Advantage of this solution is it makes it possible to reconnect with
packed ring in case of application crash, as the wrap counter values
would not be lost.

OK.
If we do that, could we also provide the possibility to pass an UUID at 
VDUSE_DEV_SETUP time?

It could be useful if we save information in a tmpfs file, in order to
be able at reconnect time to ensure the tmpfs file UUID matches with the
VDUSE device UUID, and so avoid restoring a leftover tmpfs file of a
previously detroyed then re-created VDUSE device. Would that make sense?
