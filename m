The MAC is not involved in autoneg. autoneg is between two PHYs. They
talk with each other, and then phylibs sees the results and tells the
MAC the results of the negotiation. That happens via this call
back. So i have no idea what this is doing in general in the MAC. And
in your setup, you don't have any PHYs at all. So there is no
auto-neg. You should read the datasheet and understand what this is
controlling. It might need to be disabled in general.

Why do you think that?

There are two things possible here:

A PC has no OF support, so you are using:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/of_net.h#L19

So you get the error code -ENODEV, and phyifc is not changed.

Or you are using:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/of/of_net.c#L25

There is unlikely to be a device node, so phyifc is set to
PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_NA and -ENODEV is returned.

So if of_get_phy_mode() returns an error, use RMII. Otherwise use what
value it set phyifc to.
