Hello,

I am Ama Abubakar, a lawyer here in Birmingham, Unite Kingdom. My
client who was into export/import died of COVID 19 since January 2020
and deposited over $15,000 000 with a security company for safe
keeping through me. He was a german and got divorced before his death
without kids and I made inquiry last weekend were the company director
made me to understand everything is intact and since I am the only one
aware of my disease client deposited asset, I want to ship it down to
you for us to share equally if only you can be trusted with top
secret. Kindly get back to me if I can really on you for me to
disclose more secret to you on when the company will deliver to you.

Regards,

Abubakar.
