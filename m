I haven't put this oar in the water before, but mightn't it be
possible to configure which LSM hooks can have BPF programs installed
at compile time, and thus address this issue for the "production" case?
I fully expect that such a configuration option would be hideously ugly
both to implement and use. If the impact of unused BPF hooks is so
great a concern, perhaps it would be worthwhile.

This would be my first choice. The existing list-of-hooks mechanism is
an "obvious" implementation. I have been thinking about possible ways to
make it better, but as y'all may have guessed, I haven't seen all the coo=
l
new optimization techniques.
