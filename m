Does clearing the NETIF_F_GRO for netdev->features bring back the performance?
If no, maybe there is something need investigating.

Checking rq->shared->updateRxProd in the driver to decide if gro is allow does not seems right to
me, as the netstack has used the NETIF_F_GRO checking in netif_elide_gro().

Does clearing NETIF_F_GRO for netdev->features during the driver init process works for your
case?

As netdev->hw_features is for the driver to advertise the hw's capability, and the driver
can enable/disable specific capability by setting netdev->features during the driver init
process, and user can get to enable/disable specific capability using ethtool later if user
need to.
