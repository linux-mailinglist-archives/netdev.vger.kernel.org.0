Any idea/preference how to disable access to these registers?

I agree they are broken. We really should disable access to those 16bit
registers.

Anyway here is "datasheet" to some CarlitoxxPro SFP:
https://www.docdroid.net/hRsJ560/cpgos03-0490v2-datasheet-10-pdf

And on page 10 is written:

    The I2C system can support the mode of random address / single
    byteread which conform to SFF-8431.

Which seems to be wrong.

Could you give me contact address?

Anyway, we would rather should contact Realtek chip division, real
manufacture. Not CarlitoxxPro rebrander which can just "buy product"
from Realtek reseller and put its logo on stick (and maybe configuration
like sn, mac address, password and enable/disable bit for web/telnet).

As this issue is with all those Realtek chips I really think this issue
is in underlying Realtek chip and not in CarlitoxxPro rebranding. Seems
that they know about this issue and because it affects all GPON Realtek
SFPs with that chip that cannot do anything with it, so just wrote it
into "datasheet" and trying to find arguments "why behavior is correct"
even it is not truth.

Looks like "trying to find arguments why it is correct".

At least users could do their own validation and for rewritable EEPROMs
they could be able to fix its content.

Anyway, if there is such tool then users could start creating database
of working and non-working SFPs where can be put result of this tool.

It could help people to decide which SFP they should buy and which not.
Sending page/database to manufactures with showing "do not buy this your
SFP, does not work and is broken" maybe change their state and start
doing validation if people stop buying their products or manufacture
name would be on unsupported black list.
