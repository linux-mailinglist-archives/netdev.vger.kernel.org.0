RFC->v1:
- rename poke->ip/poke->ip_aux pair to
  poke->tailcall_target/poke->tailcall_bypass (Alexei)
- get rid of x86-specific code in prog_array_map_poke_run (Alexei)
- use synchronize_rcu in prog_array_map_poke_run so that other CPUs in
  the middle of execution will finish running the program and will not
  stumble upon the incorrect state (Alexei)
- update performance reports
- drop the RFC-ish narration from descriptions
- rebase


Hello,

today bpf2bpf calls and tailcalls exclude each other. This set makes them
to work together.

To give you an overview how this work started, previously I posted RFC
that was targetted at getting rid of push/pop instructions for callee
saved registers in x86-64 JIT that are not used by the BPF program.
Alexei saw a potential that that work could be lifted a bit and
tailcalls could work with BPF subprograms. More on that in [1], [2].

For previous discussions on RFC version, see [3].

In [1], Alexei says:

"The prologue will look like:
nop5
xor eax,eaxÂ  // two new bytes if bpf_tail_call() is used in this
function
push rbp
mov rbp, rsp
sub rsp, rounded_stack_depth
push rax // zero init tail_call counter
variable number of push rbx,r13,r14,r15

Then bpf_tail_call will pop variable number rbx,..
and final 'pop rax'
Then 'add rsp, size_of_current_stack_frame'
jmp to next function and skip over 'nop5; xor eax,eax; push rpb; mov
rbp, rsp'

This way new function will set its own stack size and will init tail
call counter with whatever value the parent had.

If next function doesn't use bpf_tail_call it won't have 'xor eax,eax'.
Instead it would need to have 'nop2' in there."

So basically I gave a shot at that suggestion. Patch 4 has a description
of implementation.

Quick overview of patches:
Patch 1 changes BPF retpoline to use %rcx instead of %rax to store
address of BPF tailcall target program
Patch 2 relaxes verifier's restrictions about tailcalls being used with
BPF subprograms
Patch 3 propagates poke descriptors from main program to each subprogram
Patch 4 is the main dish in this set. It implements new prologue layout
that was suggested by Alexei and reworks tailcall handling.
Patch 5 is the new selftest that proves tailcalls can be used from
within BPF subprogram.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
prog_array_map_poke_run changes:

Before the tailcall and with the new prologue layout, stack need to be
unwinded and callee saved registers need to be popped. Instructions
responsible for that are generated, but they should not be executed if
target program is not present. To address that, new poke target
'tailcall_bypass' is introduced to poke descriptor that will be used for
skipping these instructions. This means there are two poke targets for
handling direct tailcalls. Simplified flow can be presented as three
sections:

1. skip call or nop (poke->tailcall_bypass)
2. stack unwind
3. call tail or nop (poke->tailcall_target)

It would be possible under specific circumstances that one of CPU might
be in point 2 and point 3 is not yet updated (nop), which would lead to
problems mentioned in patch 4 commit message, IOW unwind section should
not be executed if there is no target program.

We can define the following state matrix for that (courtesy of Bjorn):
A nop, unwind, nop
B nop, unwind, tail
C skip, unwind, nop
D skip, unwind, tail

A is forbidden (lead to incorrectness). The state transitions between
tailcall install/update/remove will work as follows:

First install tail call f: C->D->B(f)
 * poke the tailcall, after that get rid of the skip
Update tail call f to f': B(f)->B(f')
 * poke the tailcall (poke->tailcall_target) and do NOT touch the
   poke->tailcall_bypass
Remove tail call: B(f')->C(f')
 * poke->tailcall_bypass is poked back to jump, then we wait the RCU
   grace period so that other programs will finish its execution and
   after that we are safe to remove the poke->tailcall_target
Install new tail call (f''): C(f')->D(f'')->B(f'').
 * same as first step

This way CPU can never be exposed to "unwind, tail" state.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance impact:

All of this work, as stated in [2], started as a way to speed up AF-XDP
by dropping the push/pop of unused callee saved registers in prologue
and epilogue. Impact is positive, 15% of performance gain.

However, it is obvious that it will have a negative impact on BPF
programs that utilize tailcalls, but we think its volume is acceptable
for the feature that this set contains.

Below are te numbers from 'perf stat' for two scenarios.
First scenario is the output of command:

$ sudo perf stat -ddd -r 1024 ./test_progs -t tailcalls

tailcalls kselftest was modified in a following way:
- only taicall1 subtest is enabled
- each of the bpf_prog_test_run() calls got set 'repeat' argument to
  1000000

Numbers without this set:

Interesting fact is that I observed the huge iTLB-load-misses counts on
clean kernel as well:

flow_dissector test:
             2,613      iTLB-loads                #    0.002 M/sec ( +- 21.90% )  (30.70%)
            16,483      iTLB-load-misses          #  630.78% of all iTLB cache hits   ( +- 79.63% )  (30.68%)
tailcalls test:
             1,996      iTLB-loads                #    0.008 M/sec ( +-  1.08% )  (30.33%)
             7,272      iTLB-load-misses          #  364.24% of all iTLB cache hits   ( +- 92.01% )  (30.21%)

So probably Alexei's suspicion about get_random_int() doing strange was
right.
