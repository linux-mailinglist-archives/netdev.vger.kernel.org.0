Well if you wanted to you could probably also update ethtool_coalesce to
support a unioned __u32 array if you wanted to be more explicit about it. 

I just figured that by making in an enum it becomes less error prone since
you can't accidentally leave a gap or end up renumbering things
unintentionally. Combine that with some logic to take care of the bit
shifting and it wouldn't differ much from how we handle the netdev feature
flags and the like.

Makes sense to me.
