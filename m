No, this warning is triggered while detect a duplicate entry in the policy list

regardless of the priority. If we insert policy like this:

policy A (mark.v = 3475289, mark.m = 0, priority = 1)	//A is inserted
policy B (mark.v = 0, mark.m = 0, priority = 0) 	//B is inserted
policy C (mark.v = 3475289, mark.m = 0, priority = 0)	//C is inserted and B is deleted
policy D (mark.v = 3475289, mark.m = 0, priority = 1)	

while finding delpol in xfrm_policy_insert_list,
first round delpol is matched C, whose priority is less than D, so contiue the loop,
then A is matchedï¼Œ WARN_ON is triggered.  It seems the WARN is useless.
