It does have a '/* XXX 31 bits hole, try to pack */' but I presume the compiler
might simply zero it in this case.

Got it, my main concern is that the next time someone extends these fields with
new members we could potentially add holes in there as well and we'll run into
the same issue twice, example from the past is b85fab0e67b1 ("bpf: Add gpl_compatible
flag to struct bpf_prog_info").

Thanks,
Daniel
