The matching code is the generic driver/device matching code.
As Uwe pointed out before, we can influence the probe order only
by ordering the drivers accordingly and hoping that the core
keeps to the order of registration when probing.

But this still wouldn't solve the issue as there are PHY's with the
same PHYID having registers that need to be treated differently.
When searching the internet a little bit one easily finds old questions
regarding how to tell between KSZ8031 and KSZ8051.

I'm not a fan of workarounds like having one driver and hoping that
writing to a reserved bit on one chip doesn't hurt. You never know
whether this register/bit has an undocumented function.

If these PHY's are primarily used on DT-configured boards, then we
may consider to add DT properties for the features that differ.
