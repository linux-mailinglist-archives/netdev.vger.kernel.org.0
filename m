We're excited to announce that the call for proposals is now open for the inaugural
eBPF Summit, a virtual event, targeted at DevOps, platform architects and developers.

The goal is to have a gathering of users or potential users of eBPF(/XDP) as well as
developers in order to exchange ideas, use cases and to learn about projects utilizing
eBPF as a core technology.

The summit will be held on October 28-29th, 2020, is open to everyone and free of
charge.

Please submit your proposals or register for participation on the official summit
website at:

    https://ebpf.io/ebpf-summit-2020-cfp

Potential topics of interest include:

  - Using eBPF to troubleshoot application and system performance
  - Applying eBPF to implement zero trust, runtime security, network policy
  - Tackling infrastructure scalability challenges with eBPF
  - Applying eBPF to networking and load-balancing
  - Application profiling and tracing with eBPF
  - System and application monitoring with eBPF
  - Unlocking new levels of observability with eBPF
  - Advancements in the eBPF core infrastructure and libraries
  - eBPF community related topics

Proposals must be submitted by October 14, and submitters will be notified of
acceptance by October 16.
