Heh. Thanks for confirming. :)

Note that with the above, init_speed is only is set if qcadev->init_speed
is *not* set, so if this was needed the test would need to be negated.

But as I mentioned above, this also looks broken as qcadev->init_speed
is never set anywhere.

You could investigate and clean up this code before or after adding
support for wcn6855, but the above really doesn't look right and would
at least need to go in a separate patch with a proper explanation.

This is driver is already spamming the logs, while generally we should
only be logging when things go wrong. Those info messages can probably
be changed to dev_dbg(), but that's a separate issue and not something
that's needed to add support for wcn6855.

And same here, you can keep the above as is, but it seems like someone
will soon need to clean up the type handling as all these conditionals
are getting a bit unwieldy.

You can them in for now, but we had a discussion last fall about whether
these made up numbers really belong in the kernel.

I only skimmed that patch a while ago, but that ones not strictly needed
for wcn6855, right? Things seems to work well here with just this series
applied.

Ok. Looks like the Chromium team tried to suppress these errors when
switching line speed by toggling rts, but the frame-assembly error I get
appears to happen before that.
