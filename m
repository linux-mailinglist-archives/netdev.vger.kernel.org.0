I feel sort of ridiculous asking this over and over...  Maybe your spam
filter is eating my emails?

This bug was introduced in https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1094916/
"[v4,01/10] of_net: add NVMEM support to of_get_mac_address" but it
looks like no one applied it.

You're acting as if it *was* applied but you refuse to answer my
question who applied it and which to which tree so I can figure out what
went wrong.

I only see comments from last Friday that it shouldn't be applied...  I
also told you on Friday in a different thread that that patch shouldn't
be applied.  Breaking git bisect is a bug, and we never do that.  I'm
just very confused right now...  What I'm trying to do is figure out in
my head how this process failed so we can do better next time.

regards,
dan carpenter
