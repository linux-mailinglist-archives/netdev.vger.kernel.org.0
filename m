25000BaseX is not SGMII over clocked at 2.5GHz.

If it is using 2500BaseX then call it 2500BaseX, because 2500BaseX is
well defined in the standards, and SGMII overclocked to 2.5G is not
standardised.

Please merge it. A lot of the code is the same, and a lot of the new
code you are adding will go away once you use the helpers. And
probably you can improve the features of the older PHYs at the same
time, where features are the same between them.

And what happens when this device is used in an Ethernet switch? A
next generation of a qca8k? Take a look at
genphy_setup_master_slave().  Use MASTER_SLAVE_CFG_MASTER_PREFERRED or
MASTER_SLAVE_CFG_SLAVE_PREFERRED to decide how to bias the
master/slave decision.
