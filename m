Clause 37 is 1000BASE-X negotiation, which is different from SGMII - a
point which is even made in your PDF above in section 1.1.

You will need both ends to be operating in SGMII mode for 10M and 100M
to work. If one end is in 1000BASE-X mdoe and the other is in SGMII,
it can appear to work, but it won't be working correctly.

Please get the terminology correct here when talking about SGMII or
1000BASE-X.
