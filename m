btw, the libbpf GH repo tag v0.0.4 has 0.0.3 version set in Makefile:

  VERSION = 0
  PATCHLEVEL = 0
  EXTRAVERSION = 3

current code takes version from libbpf.map so it's fine,
but would be great to start from 0.0.5 so we don't need to
bother with rpm patches.. is 0.0.5 planned soon?

thanks,
jirka
