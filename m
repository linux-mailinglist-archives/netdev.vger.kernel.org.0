Hello

My name is Yuval Rose, a Client Relations officer at CoinMatic, A 
crypto currency exchange company based in Canada and one of 
Canada’s foremost Crypto-currency exchange platforms. I have an 
urgent lucrative business opportunity for you. I got your details 
on the internet when I was searching for a reliable person that 
can handle this deal and I believe you can handle it because you 
bears the same Last-Name with the dead investor of the business 
am about to introduce to you. This is a private and confidential 
message from me to you and I request that it be treated as such.

I am contacting you with respect to an urgent issue regarding a 
Bitcoin account belonging to a deceased account holder, I got 
your contact in my quest for a Partner to stand in as a Next of 
Kin to the deceased account holder, this was from the last 
details she sent in to the company regarding liquidation of her 
BTC account, since you might be aware that BTC transactions are 
mostly anonymous. I contacted you so that you can apply to my 
company as a relative of the deceased in order to claim the fund. 
This is as easy as ABC since my company already took a decision 
that the entire fund would be credited to any relative that comes 
up for claim before the end of December this year.

The Bitcoin was sold and converted to cash at the request of the 
late account holder for onward deposit to an account to be 
advised by her. Upon liquidation, we waited for months for info 
on the bank account for the deposit but never got a feedback. 
Upon inquiry, it was confirmed that she passed away (died) after 
a cancer related ailment.

At a meeting held 2 weeks ago by my Company’s Management on the 
matter, it was resolved that unless a Next of Kin or any relative 
of the late account Holder comes forward for claim of the funds 
on or before 30th of December 2019 (which is practically 
impossible) the whole funds would be converted back to Bitcoin 
and becomes part of the Company's portfolio.

With the above in mind, I decided to quickly reach out to you so 
that you can apply to my company for claim of this fund in the 
capacity of a Next-of-Kin/Relative. Rest assured that this is a 
straight forward process with no risks involved whatsoever. Start 
to finish of the process with fund deposited in your nominated 
bank account can be achieved within a space of 10 banking days or 
less. All that I require from you is full cooperation and 
sincerity.

I am suggestion a sharing ratio of 50/50 split after fund is 
credited to your account. We shall have to draft up an agreement 
to that effect if agreed. If this is OK with you and wish to 
continue with the claim process, I will draft a letter which you 
would email to my Company as a formal request for claim of this 
funds.

I await your reply, please provide your private phone number in 
your reply.
