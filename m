Hi Andrew, 

thanks a lot. That was the hint I needed. Now the DSA ist recognized. 
But the external PHYs are not recognized and the Serdes Ports neither.

Here is my device tree

Same error occurs when I put PHY 2 and 6 into the mdio part above 
(the PHYs are working properly in forwarding mode without DSA).

But I can read the internal PHY Identifier register (0x2 and 0x3)
over indirect mode per mdio. But I can't read the registers of the external PHYs.

Thanks in advance.
