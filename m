To make things even more complicated - I  have a project where the DSA master
should be used for time stamping. Due to board specific limitations, we
are forced to use FEC PHC instead of dsa KSZ switch PHC. So, it is not
a choice between MAC and PHY, it is more the MAC before MAC and PHY.
PTP sync in this case will have more jitter, but it still good enough
for this project.
Currently I use quick hack to do so, but mainlinamble solution working for
most use cases will be nice.

Oleksij
