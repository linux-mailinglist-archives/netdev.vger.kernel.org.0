I also see your point :)
Actually, I raised the exact same idea in a previous message:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-can/CAMZ6RqLU-Wg0Cau3cM=QsU-t-7Lyzmo1nJ_VAA4Mbw3u0jnNtw@mail.gmail.com/

But you were not in CC and it seems that there is a lot of congestion
recently on the mailing list so I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if you tell me
you did not receive it.

And also the can_{put,get}_echo_skb() I guess.

My concern is: what would be the merrit? If we do not split, the users
of slcan and v(x)can would have to load the can-dev module which will
be slightly bloated for their use, but is this really an issue? I do
not see how this can become a performance bottleneck, so what is the
problem?
I could also argue that most of the devices do not depend on
rx-offload.o. So should we also split this one out of can-dev on the
same basis and add another module dependency?
The benefit (not having to load a bloated module for three drivers)
does not outweigh the added complexity: all hardware modules will have
one additional modprobe dependency on the tiny can-skb module.

But as said above, I am not fully opposed to the split, I am just
strongly divided. If we go for the split, creating a can-skb module is
the natural and only option I see.
If the above argument does not convince you, I will send a v3 with that split.


Yours sincerely,
Vincent Mailhol
