Yes this is the default checksum. I see the same checksum when listening 
on my laptop for packets it sends out and where the NIC does checksum 
offloading.

Thanks for the links.

Thanks for the tip to remove the checksum offloading before adding the 
device to the bridge, I was already wondering why it did not work when I 
deactivated the checksum offloading later.

Thanks for the link. I also have one device with a MT7531 switch, but it 
is sued in production. I will check this in the next days.

I accidentally tested TCP Large receive offload. ;-) The driver has a 
special DMA flag for to tell the MAC that there is a Mediatek tag in the 
packet.
