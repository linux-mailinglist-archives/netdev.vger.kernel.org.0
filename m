I'm wonder that lookup keys means association of mark.v and mark.m, or the mark (mark.v & mark.m).

In above my case, policy B and C has the same mark (that is 0), if the lookup keys is mark, replacement is permitted.

If lookup keys is association of mark.v and mark.m, then:

policy E (mark.v = 0x1, mark.m = 0x3, priority = 1)
policy F (mark.v = 0x1, mark.m = 0x5, priority = 1)

E should not be replaced by F, but this is permitted now.
