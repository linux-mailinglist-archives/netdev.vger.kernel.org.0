While the drivers may implement their own page_frag_cache to manage skb->frags ...

... the skb->data is usually allocated via __netdev_alloc_skb() or
napi_alloc_skb(), which end up to the global this_cpu_ptr(&netdev_alloc_cache)
or this_cpu_ptr(&napi_alloc_cache.page).

Hi Matthew, are you going to send out the patch to avoid pfmemalloc recycle?

Thank you very much!
