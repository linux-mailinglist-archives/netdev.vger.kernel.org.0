I think in both the cases I don't expect it to work. System may end up in
different state if you register vs not. Hibernation does not work properly
at least for domU instances without these changes on x86 and I am assuming the
same for ARM.

If you do not register freeze/thaw/restore callbacks for arm, then on
invocation of xenbus_dev_suspend, default suspend/resume callbacks
will be called for each driver and since you do not have any code to save domU's
xen primitives state (syscore_ops), hibernation will either fail or will demand a reboot.
I do no have setup to test the current state of ARM's hibernation

If you only register freeze/thaw/restore and no syscore_ops, it will again fail.
Since, I do not have an ARM setup running, I quickly ran a similar test on x86,
may not be an apple to apple comparison but instance failed to resume or I
should say stuck showing huge jump in time and required a reboot.

Now if this doesn't happen currently when you trigger hibernation on arm domU
instances or if system is still alive when you trigger hibernation in xen guest
then not registering the callbacks may be a better idea. In that case  may be 
I need to put arch specific check when registering freeze/thaw/restore handlers.

Hope that answers your question.

Thanks,
Anchal
