Subject: [PATCH net-next 0/9] devlink vdev

This patchset introduces devlink vdev.

Currently, legacy tools do not provide a comprehensive solution that can
be used in both SmartNic and non-SmartNic mode.
Vdev represents a device that exists on the ASIC but is not necessarily
visible to the kernel.

Using devlink ports is not suitable because:

1. Those devices aren't necessarily network devices (such as NVMe devices)
   and doesnâ€™t have E-switch representation. Therefore, there is need for
   more generic representation of PCI VF.
2. Some attributes are not necessarily pure port attributes
   (number of MSIX vectors)
3. It creates a confusing devlink topology, with multiple port flavours
   and indices.

Vdev will be created along with flavour and attributes.
Some network vdevs may be linked with a devlink port.

This is also aimed to replace "ip link vf" commands as they are strongly
linked to the PCI topology and allow access only to enabled VFs.
Even though current patchset and example is limited to MAC address
of the VF, this interface will allow to manage PF, VF, mdev in
SmartNic and non SmartNic modes, in unified way for networking and
non-networking devices via devlink instance.

Example:

A privileged user wants to configure a VF's hw_addr, before the VF is
enabled.

$ devlink vdev set pci/0000:03:00.0/1 hw_addr 10:22:33:44:55:66

$ devlink vdev show pci/0000:03:00.0/1
pci/0000:03:00.0/1: flavour pcivf pf 0 vf 0 port_index 1 hw_addr 10:22:33:44:55:66

$ devlink vdev show pci/0000:03:00.0/1 -jp
{
    "vdev": {
        "pci/0000:03:00.0/1": {
            "flavour": "pcivf",
            "pf": 0,
            "vf": 0,
            "port_index": 1,
            "hw_addr": "10:22:33:44:55:66"
        }
    }
}

Patches 1-5 adds devlink support for vdev.
Patches 6-7 adds netdevsim implementation and test.
Patch 9 adds mlx5 vdev creation and hw_addr get/set.
