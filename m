Before commit 889b8f964f2f ("packet: Kill CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP.") there
used to be a CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP config symbol that depended on
CONFIG_PACKET. The text still refers to PACKET_MMAP as the name of this
feature, implying that it can be disabled. Another naming variant is
"Packet MMAP".

Use "PACKET mmap()" everywhere to unify the terminology. Rephrase the
text the implied mmap() feature disable option.

Also, drop reference to broken link to information for pre 2.6.5
kernels.
