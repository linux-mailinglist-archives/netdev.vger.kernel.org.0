makes sense, so something like this would be acceptable?

 eth1_addr: eth-mac-addr@18a {
     /* or rather linux,nvmem-post-process ? */
     compatible = "openwrt,nvmem-post-process";
     reg = <0x189 0x11>;
     indices = < 0 2
                 3 2
                 6 2
                 9 2
                12 2
                15 2>;
     transform = "ascii";
     increment = <1>;
     increment-at = <5>;
     result-swap;
 };

 &eth1 {
     nvmem-cells = <&eth1_addr>;
     nvmem-cell-names = "mac-address";
 };

I know, I've re-read this thread several times, but it's still unclear to me,
how this should be approached in order to be accepted by you and by DT
maintainers as well.

Anyway, to sum it up, from your point of view, following is fine?

 flash@0 {
    partitions {
        art: partition@ff0000 {
            nvmem_dev: nvmem-cells {
                compatible = "nvmem-cells";
                eth1_addr: eth-mac-addr@189 {
                    compatible = "openwrt,nvmem-post-process";
                    reg = <0x189 0x6>;
                    increment = <1>;
                    increment-at = <5>;
                    result-swap;
                };
            };
        };
    };
 };

 &eth1 {
    nvmem = <&nvmem_dev>;
    nvmem-cells = <&eth1_addr>;
    nvmem-cell-names = "mac-address";
 };
