Truth be told, we kinda just fudged it until we got GRO, since that's
what we really want on wifi (to reduce the costly TCP ACKs if possible).

Maybe we should call napi_complete_done() instead? But as Edward noted
(below), we don't actually really do NAPI polling, we just fake it for
each interrupt since we will often get a lot of frames in one interrupt
if there's high throughput (A-MPDUs are basically coming in all at the
same time). I've never really looked too much at what exactly happens
here, beyond seeing the difference from GRO.

Do tell what you think it should be doing :)

One additional wrinkle is that we have firmware notifications, command
completions and actual RX interleaved, so I think we do want to have
interrupts for the notifications and command completions?
