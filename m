Thanks for your suggestions about implementing SMC own sk_data_ready / 
sk_write_space and forwarding call to clcsock. It's a great idea. But I 
found some difficulties here in implementation process:

In my humble opinion, SMC own sk_write_space implementation should be 
called by clcsk->sk_write_space and complete the following steps:

1) Get smc_sock through clcsk->sk_user_data, like what did in 
smc_clcsock_data_ready().

2) Forward call to original clcsk->sk_write_space, it MIGHT wake up 
clcsk->sk_wq, depending on whether certain conditions are met.

3) Wake up smc sk->sk_wq to nodify application if clcsk->sk_write_space 
acctually wakes up clcsk->sk_wq.

In step 3), it seems a bit troublesome for SMC to know whether 
clcsk->sk_write_space acctually wake up clcsk->sk_wq, which is a black 
box to SMC.

There might be a feasible way that add a wait_queue_head_t to 
clcsk->sk_wq and report to SMC when clcsk->sk_wq is waked up. Then SMC 
can report to application by waking up smc sk->sk_wq. But that seems to 
be complex and redundancy.

I'm looking forward to hear your opinion about it. Thank you!


cheers,
Wen Gu
