They are in /sys/class/net/eth0/phydev/leds by default, because they
are children of the PHY device and are of `leds` class, and the PHY
subsystem creates a symlink `phydev` when PHY is attached to the
interface.
They are in /sys/class/leds/ as symlinks, because AFAIK everything in
/sys/class/<CLASS>/ is a symlink...

If you move eth0 to other network namespace, naturally the
/sys/class/net/eth0 symlink will disappear, as will the directory it
pointed to.

The symlink phydev does will disappear from /sys/class/net/eth0/
directory after eth0 is moved to ns1, and is lost. It does not return
even if eth0 is moved back to root namespace.

The LED will of course stay in ns1 and also in root namespace, as will
the phydev the LED is a child to. But they are no longer accessible via
/sys/class/net/eth0, instead you can access the LEDs either via
/sys/class/leds or /sys/class/mdio_bus/<MDIO_BUS>/<PHY>/leds, or
without symlinks via /sys/devices/ tree.
