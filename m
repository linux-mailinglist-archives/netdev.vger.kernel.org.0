They are broken in a way that neither holy water help them...

But from diagnostic 0x51 address we can read at least 8bit registers in
atomic way :-)

We have just two options:

Disable 2 (and more) bytes reads from 0x51 address and therefore disable
sfp_hwmon_read_sensor() function.

Or allow 2 bytes non-atomic reads and allow at least semi-correct values
for hwmon. I guess that upper 8bits would not change between two single
byte i2c transfers too much (when they are done immediately one by one).

But in any case we really need to set read operation for this eeprom to
one byte.
