If I glanced over this discussion correctly, it is about avoiding
promiscuity under certain circumstances (while promiscuity was
only requested for switching and not by userspace) because HW promiscuity
is not needed in that particular case.

As I currently see it, there are two common use cases for promiscuity:

1) Applying filtering, switching and other logic on the CPU.
   This could be due to limited resources in the NIC, e.g. when there
   are too many unicast addresses configured on that interface or
   simply an unavailable hardware capability.

2) Sniffing the wire.

The kernel uses IFF_PROMISC (or `__dev_set_promiscuity()`) for both,
which obviously can be overkill in the first case.
The question remains, what does IFF_PROMISC exactly mean for userspace
(which, I guess, most often uses it for 2)?

Admittedly, I certainly don't know, but hoped to find whom who does on

Yes, that's exactly what I was referring to.
I find it slightly annoying on RAW sockets, but it's documented and
(hopefully) consistent behaviour now, so okay for me.

In that case, maybe new features which could alter user-visible behaviour
should not be enabled by default?
If I am not mistaken, bridging offload, IP forwarding offload and
similar have to be enabled explicitly, at least.

I am not convinced that this definition would indeed contradict the
IEEE standard. It might just be a stronger one with more guarantees.
Assuming you have a very stupid NIC without any filtering or offloading
capabilities, which would always forward all frames to the CPU.
Would this NIC not comply to the standard?

@Jakub
May I take your answer as a final decision or would you prefer some more
input on this?

Well, that just meant, that there should always be a way, but no
universal one.
Which one depends on your exact hardware setup or maybe even the current
constellation of stars...

Other Drivers
=============

So I tried to figure out what other existing hardware drivers do
by grepping for drivers which do something on a change to
NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_FILTER.

Here are the results of me trying to understand the drivers quickly.
I hope it's somewhat close and helps:

1) aqc111
   This controller has a HW register flag for promiscuous mode.
   I am not sure what it does, but since this is another ASIX
   device, the documentation from above should apply.

2) lan78xx
   Here it began ...

3) ixgbe
   This driver disables HW_VLAN_CTAG_FILTER if IFF_PROMISC is set.

4) ice
   I don't know.

5) ocelot_net
   This driver does not support promiscuous mode with the following
   explanation:
	/* This doesn't handle promiscuous mode because the bridge core is
	 * setting IFF_PROMISC on all slave interfaces and all frames would be
	 * forwarded to the CPU port.
	 */
   See the already mentioned discussion https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/29/255
   for more.

6) liquidio
   This driver also has a HW flag for promiscuous mode.
   I don't know what it does, though.

7) mvpp2
   This driver disables vid filtering if IFF_PROMISC is set.

8) efx
	/* Disable VLAN filtering by default.  It may be enforced if
	 * the feature is fixed (i.e. VLAN filters are required to
	 * receive VLAN tagged packets due to vPort restrictions).
	 */
   I did not find a variant that really honors this feature.

9) ef100
   I don't know.

10) mlx5
   This driver sets a HW promisc flag, adds an `ANY` vlan filter rule
   and ignores further changes to vlan filtering if IFF_PROMISC is set.

11) nfp
   This driver uses a HW promisc flag.

12) atlantic
   I don't know.

13) xlgmac
   This one has an interesting comment in `xlgmac_set_promiscuous_mode`:
	/* Hardware will still perform VLAN filtering in promiscuous mode */
	if (enable) {
		xlgmac_disable_rx_vlan_filtering(pdata);
	} else {
		if (pdata->netdev->features & NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_FILTER)
			xlgmac_enable_rx_vlan_filtering(pdata);
	}

14) enetc
   I think, the feature is overridden everytime in `set_rx_mode` as long
   as IFF_PROMISC is set.

15) xgbe
   In `xgbe_set_promiscuous_mode` once again:
	/* Hardware will still perform VLAN filtering in promiscuous mode */
	if (enable) {
		xgbe_disable_rx_vlan_filtering(pdata);
	} else {
		if (pdata->netdev->features & NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_FILTER)
			xgbe_enable_rx_vlan_filtering(pdata);
	}


Implementation
==============

I then tried to come up with a solution in net/core that would
universally disable vlan filtering in promiscuous mode.
Removing the features in `netdev_fix_features` is easily done, but
updating the active set of features whenever IFF_PROMISC changes
seems hard.

`__dev_set_promiscuity` is often called in atomic context but
`.ndo_set_features` can sleep in many drivers.

Adding a work_queue or similar to every net_device seems clumsy and
inappropriate.

Rewriting ndo_set_features of all drivers to be atomic is not a task
you should ask from me...

Calling `netdev_update_features` after every entrypoint that locks
the rtnl seems too error-prone and also clumsy.

Only updating the features when promiscuity was explicitly requested
by userspace in `dev_change_flags` might leave the device in a
weird inconsistent state.

Continue to let each driver enforce the kernels definition of
promiscuity. They know how to update the features atomically.
Then I am back at my original patch...

I'm afraid, I might need some guidance on how to approach this.


Thanks for your help and all of your responses
