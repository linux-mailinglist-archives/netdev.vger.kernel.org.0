Hello!

Thank you for sending these patches! I'll start poking a bit at the
Go-Landlock library to see how we can support it there when this lands.

What is the point of asking user space to convert this to network byte
order? It seems to me that the kernel would be able to convert it to
network byte order very easily internally and in a single place -- why
ask all of the users to deal with that complexity? Am I overlooking
something?

This is a more high-level comment:

The notion of a 16-bit "port" seems to be specific to TCP and UDP --
how do you envision this struct to evolve if other protocols need to
be supported in the future?

Should this struct and the associated constants have "TCP" in its
name, and other protocols use a separate struct in the future?

         "through" a SUID binary? "thanks to" sounds like it's desired
         to do that, while we're actually trying to prevent it here?
