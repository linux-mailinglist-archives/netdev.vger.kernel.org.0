W/o knowing the exact issue in detail: For the sake of bisectability,
shouldn't patches 4 and a modified patch 3 be first? After patches 1 and 2
we may be in trouble, right?

And it seems you composed the mails manually:
- subject is prefixed with "Subject:"
- patch subjects in the cover letter don't match the ones of the
  respective patches

For the patch prefixes: Please add a space between net: and phy:
