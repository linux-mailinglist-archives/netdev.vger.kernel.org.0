The Ethernet controllers have a good number of generic options that can be
needed in a device tree. Add a YAML schemas for those.

-Fixed link Device Tree binding
-------------------------------
-
-Some Ethernet MACs have a "fixed link", and are not connected to a
-normal MDIO-managed PHY device. For those situations, a Device Tree
-binding allows to describe a "fixed link".
-
-Such a fixed link situation is described by creating a 'fixed-link'
-sub-node of the Ethernet MAC device node, with the following
-properties:
-
-* 'speed' (integer, mandatory), to indicate the link speed. Accepted
-  values are 10, 100 and 1000
-* 'full-duplex' (boolean, optional), to indicate that full duplex is
-  used. When absent, half duplex is assumed.
-* 'pause' (boolean, optional), to indicate that pause should be
-  enabled.
-* 'asym-pause' (boolean, optional), to indicate that asym_pause should
-  be enabled.
-* 'link-gpios' ('gpio-list', optional), to indicate if a gpio can be read
-  to determine if the link is up.
-
-Old, deprecated 'fixed-link' binding:
-
-* A 'fixed-link' property in the Ethernet MAC node, with 5 cells, of the
-  form <a b c d e> with the following accepted values:
-  - a: emulated PHY ID, choose any but but unique to the all specified
-    fixed-links, from 0 to 31
-  - b: duplex configuration: 0 for half duplex, 1 for full duplex
-  - c: link speed in Mbits/sec, accepted values are: 10, 100 and 1000
-  - d: pause configuration: 0 for no pause, 1 for pause
-  - e: asymmetric pause configuration: 0 for no asymmetric pause, 1 for
-    asymmetric pause
-
-Examples:
-
-ethernet@0 {
-	...
-	fixed-link {
-	      speed = <1000>;
-	      full-duplex;
-	};
-	...

-ethernet@1 {

-	fixed-link {
-	      speed = <1000>;
-	      pause;
