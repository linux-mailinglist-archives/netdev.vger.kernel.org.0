One question though. I know that Felix overruns the time gate, i.e. when
the time interval has any value larger than 32 ns, the switch port is
happy to send any packet of any size, regardless of whether the duration
of transmission exceeds the gate size or not. In doing so, it violates
this requirement from IEEE 802.1Q-2018 clause 8.6.8.4 Enhancements for
scheduled traffic:

-----------------------------[ cut here ]-----------------------------
In addition to the other checks carried out by the transmission selection algorithm, a frame on a traffic class
queue is not available for transmission [as required for tests (a) and (b) in 8.6.8] if the transmission gate is in
the closed state or if there is insufficient time available to transmit the entirety of that frame before the next
gate-close event (3.97) associated with that queue. A per-traffic class counter, TransmissionOverrun
(12.29.1.1.2), is incremented if the implementation detects that a frame from a given queue is still being
transmitted by the MAC when the gate-close event for that queue occurs.

NOTE 1â€”It is assumed that the implementation has knowledge of the transmission overheads that are involved in
transmitting a frame on a given Port and can therefore determine how long the transmission of a frame will take.
However, there can be reasons why the frame size, and therefore the length of time needed for its transmission, is
unknown; for example, where cut-through is supported, or where frame preemption is supported and there is no way of
telling in advance how many times a given frame will be preempted before its transmission is complete. It is desirable
that the schedule for such traffic is designed to accommodate the intended pattern of transmission without overrunning
the next gate-close event for the traffic classes concerned.
-----------------------------[ cut here ]-----------------------------

Is this not the reason why the guard bands were added, to make the
scheduler stop sending any frame for 1 MAX_SDU in advance of the gate
close event, so that it doesn't overrun the gate?
