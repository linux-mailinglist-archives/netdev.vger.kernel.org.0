we plan to count info available through field in the registers.
See paragraph 3.1.39 TXTB_INFO

http://canbus.pages.fel.cvut.cz/ctucanfd_ip_core/doc/Datasheet.pdf

The bits are read as zeros on the older version so if the zero
is found older default 4 will be chosen by the driver.
So I prefer no side information channel DTC etc.
Even on the actual PCI integration you can read number
of channels from the support PCI BAR range and locate
actual cores on the other BAR.

My shame. I hoped to get driver into mainline till Embedded World
Conference 2022 where we participate with our RISC-V education tools
and materials so that I could report to others in the RISC-V camp
and even CiA that we are finally easily to use.

On the other hand more time gives time for better review and possible
cleanup. But I would wait with features addition till some base
accepted to the next or mainline. I hope that interfaces will not
change too much before inclusion that actual tested code can
get in.

Yes but you do not need exact bitrate even when it is available.
I do no look into standards now, but I think 1% error should not be
a problem. May it be even 3% error when whole jitter and clocks
frequency errors fit below it should work (5 (bit stuff) x 3% = 15%
is less than 100% - 80% (typical SP) and with well tuned SF even 25
or 50% of the last bit could be accepted that communication can
at leas sometimes succeed). So allow error of 0.1% as better than
too low or too high TQ per bit or strange SJW can be acceptable.
On the other hand if CAN is used with time triggered stuff or keep/
synchronize whole plant global time then 0.1% is too much.
So at the end in this case really tuning for concrete application
comes into play. But in kernel algorithm is there to make most
common usages easy...

Yes.

I hope that community joint forces can reach state where
CAN FD will be solved on all FPGA and combinations easily
and open source way. We need to find way for funding
of certification and long term sustainability.
But at least our previous release and actual public
code is game level save point.
