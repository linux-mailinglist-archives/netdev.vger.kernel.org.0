Hello there,

I am Muhammad Faraz. I hope you and your family are keeping safe=20
during this Covid-19 pandemic. I sent you an email a few days ago=20
but I did not receive a reply. I am not sure if you got that=20
email or not. Anyways, I got your contact from an online business=20
directory and I am contacting you because I have a proposal that=20
I think you may be interested in. Before I proceed, I want you to=20
keep an open mind and try your best to read my proposal=20
carefully. I represent the interest of my brother in-law who was=20
a former top politician in the Syrian Government cabinet. As you=20
probably know, there is a lot of crisis going on currently in=20
Syria with regards to the senseless war and killings. My brother=20
in-law is one of the few people that has spoken against this and=20
have been trying to advocate for a more peaceful and prosperous=20
country. Unfortunalely, his position has put him in a very=20
difficult situation with the ruling political party and they are=20
doing everything possible to falsely accuse him of plooting a=20
coup againt the Government. Due to this situation, my brother in-
law belives that he is at risk and he is now very scared for the=20
safety of his family especially his kids. In order to ensure that=20
his family is taken care of and protected incase anything happens=20
to him, he has asked me to help him find a foreign businessman=20
who can help him accommodate and invest the assets he has in=20
Europe. He wants these assets safely invested so that the future=20
and safety of his family can be secured.

I am contacting you with the hope that you will be interested in=20
helping us. We need your help to invest the funds in lucrative=20
projects in your country that will yeild good profits. Everything=20
will be handled in a legal and transparent manner and we will=20
handle all the logistics involved in the movement of the funds to=20
you. You will also be very much compensated for your help if you=20
decide to work with us. If this proposal interests you, please=20
kindly respond so that I can give you more details including the=20
proof of funds and other relevant details. I hope to hear from=20
you soon.

Regards,

Muhammad.
