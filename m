There is no special sauce required to get a DHCP daemon working nor BFD.
It is supposed to Just Work. Same for IGMP / MLD snooping, STP etc. This
is enabled by the ASIC trapping the required packets to the CPU.

However, having a 3.2/6.4/12.8 Tbps ASIC (it keeps growing all the time)
send traffic to the CPU can very easily result in denial of service. You
need to have hardware policers and classification to different traffic
classes ensuring the system remains functional regardless of the havoc
happening in the offloaded data path.

This control plane policy has been hard coded in mlxsw for a few years
now (based on sane defaults), but it obviously does not fit everyone's
needs. Different users have different use cases and different CPUs
connected to the ASIC. Some have Celeron / Atom while others have more
high-end Xeon CPUs, which are obviously capable of handling more packets
per second. You also have zero visibility into how many packets were
dropped by these hardware policers.

By exposing these traps we allow users to tune these policers and get
visibility into how many packets they dropped. In the future also
changing their traffic class, so that (for example), packets hitting
local routes are scheduled towards the CPU before packets dropped due to
ingress VLAN filter.

If you don't have any special needs you are probably OK with the
defaults, in which case you don't need to do anything (no special
sauce).
