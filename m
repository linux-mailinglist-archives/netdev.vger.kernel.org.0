Hi Alvin,

They refuse to probe at all with the Generic PHY driver. I have been
caught off guard a few times now when I had a kernel built with
CONFIG_NXP_C45_TJA11XX_PHY=n and their probing returns -22 in that case.

I don't test with "fw_devlink=on" in /proc/cmdline, this is the first
time I do it. It behaves exactly as you say.

So it's a circular dependency? Switch cannot finish probing because it
cannot connect to PHY, which cannot probe because switch has not
finished probing, which....

So how is it supposed to be solved then? Intuitively the 'mdio_bus SMI-0:00'
device should not be added to the deferred list, it should have everything
it needs right now (after all, it works without fw_devlink). No?

It might be the late hour over here too, but right now I just don't
know. Let me add Saravana to the discussion too, he made an impressive
analysis recently on a PHY probing issue with mdio-mux, so the PHY
library probing dependencies should still be fresh in his mind, maybe he
has an idea what's wrong.

Yeah, rest assured, you're not the only one.
