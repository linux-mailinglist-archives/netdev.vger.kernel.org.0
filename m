I think SET_RINGS is OK for tx push, but next new device feature would
still have this problem. As far as I know, features such as promisc,
tx push are driver features. So should I still work on the new devfeature
command netlink version for these standard driver features?

It would be nice to have clear rules about which command does new feature
need to be added to.
