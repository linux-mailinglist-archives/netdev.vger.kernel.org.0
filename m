Subject: [PATCH net-next] dt-bindings: ethernet-controller: support multiple PHY connection types
Date:   Sun, 31 Oct 2021 20:18:49 +0100

Sometimes, an ethernet PHY may communicate with ethernet controller with
different PHY connection types, and the software should be able to choose
between them.

Existing example is one SerDes lane capable of `1000base-x`,
`2500base-x` and `sgmii` when connecting Marvell switches with Marvell
ethernet controller. Currently we mention only one of these modes in
device-tree, and software assumes the other modes are also supported,
since they use the same SerDes lanes. But a board may be able to support
`1000base-x` and not support `2500base-x`, for example due to the higher
frequency not working correctly on a particular board.

Another example is the Marvell 88X3310 PHY, which supports connecting
the MAC with the PHY with `xaui` and `rxaui`. The MAC may also support
both modes, but it is possible that a particular board doesn't have
these modes wired (since they use multiple SerDes lanes).

In order for the kernel to know which modes are supported on the board,
we need to be able to specify them all in the device-tree.

Change the property `phy-connection-type` of an ethernet controller to
be an array of the enumerated strings, with at least one item defined,
if the property is mentioned.
