Marek: I'm adding you in case you could be able to give this a try and
make sure it doesn't break suspend for dom0.

Er no to both I think. What I meant is that a PVH dom0 should be able
to properly suspend, and we should make sure this work doesn't make
this any harder (or breaks it if it's currently working).

Or at least that's how I understood the question raised by Boris.

You are adding code to the generic suspend path that's also used by dom0
in order to perform bare metal suspension. This is fine now for a PV
dom0 because the code is gated on xen_hvm_domain, but you should also
take into account that a PVH dom0 is considered a HVM domain, and
hence will get the notifier registered.

I've now added Marek.

Roger.
