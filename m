Reducing the attack surface on the kernel is valuable but not the 
primary goal of Landlock. seccomp is designed for this task and a 
seccomp filters can easily forbid creation of specific sockets. We 
should consider using both Landlock and seccomp, and your use case of 
denying UDP vs. TCP is good.

Anyway, the LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_CREATE_TCP_SOCKET_DENY name in not 
appropriate. Indeed, mixing "access" and "deny" doesn't make sense. A 
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_CREATE_TCP access could be useful if we can define 
such TCP socket semantic, e.g. with a port, which is not possible when 
creating a socket, and it is OK.
