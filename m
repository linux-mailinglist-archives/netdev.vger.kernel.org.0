Hi Laurent,

thanks for your patches :) Can you check your setup since we get 6
individual emails: 'git send-email --thread ...' ;)

Not only during the power-up sequence. The complete phy internal state
machine (the hardware state machine) gets confused if the clock is
turned off randomly.

Holding the Phy within reset during the FEC is in reset seems wrong to
me because: The clock can be supplied by an external crystal/oszi. This
would add unnecessary delays. Also this is again a FEC/SMSC combination
fix again. The phy has the same problem on other hosts if they are the
clock provider and toggling the ref-clk.

There is also a deprecated "phy-reset-gpios" did you test this as well?

Nope that's not true, you can specify the clock within the device-tree
so the fec-ref-clk isn't disabled anymore.

You can't disable the clock. What you listing here means that the smsc
phy needs to be re-initialized after such an clock loss. If we can
disbale the clock randomly we wouldn't need to re-initialize the phy
again.
