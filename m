I think user experience would be better if users don't have to know that
/proc/config.gz exists and even more so if they don't need to read it. By
default libbpf should pick all CONFIG_* from known locations and in addition if
extra text is specified for bpf_object_open_opts() the libbpf can take the
values from there. So may be .kconfig_path can be replaced with
.additional_key_value_pairs ? I think override of /proc/config.gz is
unnecessary. Whereas additional predefined externs are useful for testing and
passing load-time configuration to bpf progs. Like IP addresses, etc.
