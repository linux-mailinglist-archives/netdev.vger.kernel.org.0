I forgot to update this part of the cover letter since v4.
This paragraph is outdated and should now be:

| The main purpose of this series is to report the CAN controller
| capabilities. To do so, a new IFLA_CAN_* entry is
| added:â€¯IFLA_CAN_CTRLMODE_EXT. This is done to guarantee forward
| and backward compatibility in the netlink interface.

N.B. I do not plan to send a v7 because the patch descriptions
are correct (only the cover letter was outdated).
