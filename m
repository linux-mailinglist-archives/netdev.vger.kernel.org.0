Greetings my beloved

How are you doing today? I hope well. My name is Miss Amanda Kipkalya
Kones, I am 24 years old, I am a girl I held from Kenya in East
Africa. My father was the former Kenyan road Minister. He and
Assistant Minister of Home Affairs Lorna Laboso had been on board the
Cessna 210, which was headed to Kericho and crashed in a remote area
called Kajong, in western Kenya. The plane crashed on the Tuesday
10th, June, 2008. You can read more about the crash through the below
site:

http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/kenya.crash/index.html

My Late father of blessed memory deposited the sum of $6.7M ( Six
Million seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ) in ISLAMIC GROUP AFRICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK BURKINA FASO which he used my name as the next of
kin. However, I shall forward you with the necessary documents on
confirmation of your acceptance to assist me for the transfer and
statement of the fund in your country as my trusted investment
manager/partner because of my current refugee status,

After the burial of my father, my stepmother and uncle conspired and
sold my father's property to an Italian Expert rate which the shared
the money among themselves and live nothing for me. I am constrained
to contact you because of the abuse I am receiving from my wicked
stepmother and uncle. They planned to take away all my late father's
treasury and properties from me since the unexpected death of my
beloved Father. Luckily they did not discover where I kept my fathers
File which contains important documents. So I decided to run to the
refugee camp where I am presently seeking asylum under the United
Nations High Commission for the Refugee here in Ouagadougou, Republic
of Burkina Faso. well I will say that my mind convinced me that you
may be the true person to help me. More so please reply me,

Kisses and warmest regards
Yours friend
Miss Amanda Kipkalya Kones.
