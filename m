I fail to understand the problem here.

1. Because ESTABLISHED and INVALID are mutually exclusive, there is no ordering
dependency between two rules of the kind {EST=>ACCEPT, INV=>REJ},
and thus their order plays no role.

2. Given packets D,R (data, rst) leads to state(ct(D))=EST, state(ct(R))=EST in
the normal case. When this gets reordered to R,D, then we end up with
state(ct(R))=EST, state(ct(D))=INV. Though the outcome of nfct changes,
I do not think that will be of consequence, because in the absence of
filtering, the tcp layer should be discarding/rejecting D.

3. Natural reordering of D1,D2 to D2,D1 should not cause nfct to drop the ct
at reception of D1 and turn the state to INV. Reordering can happen at any
time, and we'd be having more reports of problems if it did, wouldn't we...
