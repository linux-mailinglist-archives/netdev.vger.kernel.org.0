Is there any reason not to introduce back the per socket defer_list to
not acquire the defer_lock for one skb at a time instead of adding
per-cpu caches?

How about only optimize napi_by_id()?
To be honest, I am not sure how to optimize it exactly, maybe add a callback
to notify the deletion of napi to the socket?
