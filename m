I am not sure. I am really talking about a softMAC. I am not sure
where to put that layer "vertically" but according to the spec the MCPS
(MAC Common Part Sublayer) is the layer that contains the data
primitives, while MLME has been designed for management and
configuration.

Yeah I see what you mean, but IMHO that's basically duplicating the
softMAC layer, we already have hwsim wired to cfg802154 through
mac802154. In a certain way we could argue that this is a hardMAC =)
