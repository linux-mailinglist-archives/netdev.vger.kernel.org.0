[+cc Jesse, Tony, David, Jakub, Heiner, lists in case there's an ASPM
issue with I211 or Realtek NICs.  Beginning of thread:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20201024205548.1837770-1-ian.kumlien@gmail.com

Short story: Ian has:

  Root Port --- Switch --- I211 NIC
                       \-- multifunction Realtek NIC, etc

and the I211 performance is poor with ASPM L1 enabled on both links
in the path to it.  The patch here disables ASPM on the upstream link
and fixes the performance, but AFAICT the devices in that path give us
no reason to disable L1.  If I understand the spec correctly, the
Realtek device should not be relevant to the I211 path.]

Yes.  That's what I said above: "it is not safe to enable L1 for both
Links."  Unless I'm missing something, we agree on that.

I also said that it should be safe to enable L1 on the shared Link
(from 00:01.2 to 01:00.0) because if the downstream Link is always in
L0, the exit latency of the shared Link should be <32us, and 04:00.x
can tolerate 64us.

This is a bit of a tangent and we shouldn't get too wrapped up in it.
This is a confusing aspect of PCIe.  We're talking about this path:

  00:01.2 --- [01:00.0 -- 02:04.0] --- 04:00.x multifunction Realtek

This path only contains two Links.  The first one is 
00:01.2 --- 01:00.0, and the second one is 02:04.0 --- 04:00.x.

01:00.0 is a Switch Upstream Port and 02:04.0 is a Switch Downstream
Port.  The connection between them is not a Link; it is some internal
wiring of the Switch that is completely opaque to software.

The ASPM information and knobs in 01:00.0 apply to the Link on its
upstream side, and the ASPM info and knobs in 02:04.0 apply to the
Link on its downstream side.

The example in sec 5.4.1.2.2 contains three Links.  The L1 exit latency
for the Link is the max of the exit latencies at each end:

  Link 1: max(32, 8) = 32us
  Link 2: max(8, 32) = 32us
  Link 3: max(32, 8) = 32us

The total delay for a TLP starting at the downstream end of Link 3
is 32 + 2 = 32us.

In the path to your 04:00.x Realtek device:

  Link 1 (from 00:01.2 to 01:00.0): max(32, 32) = 32us
  Link 2 (from 02:04.0 to 04:00.x): max(32, 64) = 64us

If L1 were enabled on both Links, the exit latency would be 64 + 1 =
65us.

> rest state if no links are up.

I don't think this is quite true -- a Link can't enter L1 unless the
Ports on both ends have L1 enabled, so I don't think it makes sense to
talk about an individual Port being in L1.

As I said above, if we enabled L1 only on the shared Link from 00:01.2
to 01:00.0, the exit latency should be acceptable.  In that case, a
TLP from 04:00.x would see only 32us of latency:

  Link 1 (from 00:01.2 to 01:00.0): max(32, 32) = 32us

and 04:00.x can tolerate 64us.

[1] is the "lspci without my patches" attachment of bugzilla #209725,
which is supposed to show the problem this patch solves.  We're
talking about the path to 04:00.x, and [1] show this:

  01:00.2 L1+
  01:00.0 L1+
  02:04.0 L1-
  04:00.0 L1-

AFAICT, that should be a legal configuration as far as 04:00.0 is
concerned, so it's not a reason for this patch.

[2] is a previous posting of this same patch, and its commit log
includes information about the same path to 04:00.x, but the "LnkCtl
Before" column shows:

  01:00.2 L1+
  01:00.0 L1+
  02:04.0 L1+
  04:00.0 L1+

I don't know why [1] shows L1 disabled on the downstream Link, while
[2] shows L1 *enabled* on the same Link.

The text in quotes above is straight out of the spec (PCIe r5.0, sec
7.5.3.7).  Either the device works that way or it's not compliant.

The OS configures ASPM based on the requirements and capabilities
advertised by the device.  If a device has any head of queue stalling
or similar issues, those must be comprehended in the numbers
advertised by the device.  It's not up to the OS to speculate about
issues like that.

We're trying to establish exactly *what* Linux is doing wrong.  So far
we don't have a good explanation of that.

Based on [1], in the path to 03:00.0, both Links have L1 enabled, with
an exit latency of <33us, and 03:00.0 can tolerate 64us.  That should
work fine.

Also based on [1], in the path to 04:00.x, the upstream Link has L1
enabled and the downstream Link has L1 disabled, for an exit latency
of <32us, and 04:00.0 can tolerate 64us.  That should also work fine.

(Alternately, disabling L1 on the upstream Link and enabling it on the
downstream Link should have an exit latency of <64us and 04:00.0 can
tolerate 64us, so that should work fine, too.)

There's clearly a problem on your system, but I don't know yet whether
Linux is doing something wrong, a device in your system is designed
incorrectly, or a device is designed correctly but the instance in
your system is defective.

> It's been five months...

I apologize for the delay.  ASPM is a subtle area of PCIe, the Linux
code is complicated, and we have a long history of issues with it.  I
want to fix the problem, but I want to make sure we do it in a way
that matches the spec so the fix applies to all systems.  I don't want
a magic fix that fixes your system in a way I don't quite understand.

Obviously *you* understand this, so hopefully it's just a matter of
pounding it through my thick skull :)
