FIRST DRAFT 11 NOVEMBER 2019 (11.11.2019)

My name is Mr. Turritopsis Dohrnii Teo En Ming. The full legal name on
my Singapore NRIC identity card (government issued ID) is Turritopsis
Dohrnii Teo En Ming (Zhang Enming) =E5=BC=A0=E6=81=A9=E9=B8=A3 @ Time Trave=
ller. Anything
after the "@" symbol is an alias. I am a Singaporean Targeted
Individual (TI) living in Singapore. I was born in Kandang Kerbau
Hospital in Singapore in 1978 (according to my birth certificate).
That makes me 41 years old at the time of this writing (21 October
2019).

I am a technical person, not a literary person. Please bear with my
English if it does not conform to your expectations.

In the year 1984, I completed my 2nd year kindergarten course at a
People's Action Party (PAP) Community Foundation Kindergarten
somewhere in Bedok North in Singapore. When I was born, I was already
living in Bedok North.

1985: Enrolled into Yu Neng Primary School. Started primary school year 1.

1989: I was transferred to Huamin Primary School (during primary
school year 5) when my family moved to Yishun Avenue 5. It was at this
time that I realized that something is wrong with my mother. She was
hearing voices and thought that our Yishun neighbors were scolding her
all the time. Anyone who hears voices is a Targeted Individual.

1990: Completed primary school education with a Primary School Leaving
Examination (PSLE) score of 238.

1991: Enrolled into Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School. Started secondary

aphy.

1993: I was 2nd in Level for Secondary 3 (Express) and awarded 1st in Geogr=
aphy.

1994: Completed my secondary school education. I was the GCE "O" Level
Top Student at my secondary school, after obtaining 7 A1s and an A2
for my GCE "O" Level Examination in 1994. Awarded certificate of merit
for Outstanding Performance in GCE "O" Level Examination 1994, 1st in

1995: Enrolled into Diploma in Mechatronics course at Singapore Polytechnic=
.

Awarded Cadence Prize for outstanding academic performance in the
First Year Diploma in Mechatronics Course.

Awarded Cadence Prize for meritorious academic performance in the
Second Year Diploma in Mechatronics Course.

Awarded Frontline Technologies Prize and Motorola Prize for
meritorious academic performance in the Diploma in Mechatronics Course
(overall).

1998: Graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma in
Mechatronics (with Merit). Conscripted into the Singapore army.

2001: Completed National Service. Enrolled into mechanical engineering
undergraduate degree course at the National University of Singapore
(NUS).

December 2006: Completed university studies with a Bachelor of
Engineering (Mechanical Engineering) Second Class Honours (Lower)
degree.

Afer graduation from NUS, I got a job as an Engineer (Information
Technology) at Defense Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) in
February 2007. I was young and impulsive with a lot of anger and
frustrations due to my family situation. I was also extremely
retarded, extremely imbecile and an idiot. When I was having a private
casual conversation with my manager Mr. Loh Choon Fah in his office at
DSTA, I said:

"Singapore is not a democracy. When Singapore strong man Lee Kuan Yew
is gone, there would be more freedoms in the country."

As a consequence of my retarded, idiotic and careless remarks on
Singapore Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, I failed to obtain Top Secret
security clearance when I was in DSTA and was forced to resign in
August 2007. On retrospection, it was the year 2007 that I became
targeted and began hearing menacing and threatening voices from the
government. The Singapore Government had waged psychological warfare
on me.

Governments all over the world have been covertly using Government
Mind Control Technology (GMCT) for decades to make their own citizens
hear government voices. You should read "Microwave Weapons Are Prime
Suspect in Ills of U.S. Embassy Workers" published by The New York
Times. This is the Gospel for Targeted Individuals (TIs). The link is
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/science/sonic-attack-cuba-microwave.html

There are 3 major functions of Government Mind Control Technology:

(1) Read your mind and thoughts remotely. This is also known as Remote
Neural Monitoring (RNM).

(2) See through your eyes.

(3) Hear through your ears.

Targeted Individuals (TIs) are constantly under 24x7 thought surveillance.

In September 2007, I found another job as a System Engineer
(Information Technology) at NCS Pte Ltd. I couldn't concentrate on my
job due to constant targeting by the Singapore Government, so I had to
leave my job after one year in August 2008.

After some job searching, I joined AsiaSoft Online Pte Ltd as an
Information Systems Engineer in February 2009. There was a change of
IT manager in September 2009. The new IT manager Mr. Melvin Lee had
challenged me to complete an IT project in a few weeks. I was
retarded, imbecile and idiotic once again. In response to his
challenge, I used Singapore Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew as a bet. I
told Melvin Lee that if I couldn't complete the assigned IT project in
2 or 3 weeks, then Singapore Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew would be a
wang ba dan [Hanyu Pinyin]. In Chinese language, wang ba dan [Hanyu
Pinyin] refers to a tortoise or turtle. Before I could realize it,
targeting by the Singapore Government had become much much much more
worse and increased many many many folds. I deeply regretted my
imbecility and stupidity. I left AsiaSoft Online Pte Ltd in October
2009 due to paranoia.

November 2009: I was the first person in the world to have
ported/converted Google Chrome OS for netbooks from 32-bit to 64-bit.
I have also added in support for open source Xen virtualization. I
named it ChromiumOS64.

Between October 2009 and December 2011, I went through hell on Planet
Earth. I hear menacing and threatening voices from the Singapore
Government every day and every minute.

Fast forward to the year 2011, my family moved from Bedok Reservoir
Road to Toa Payoh. We had moved from Yishun Avenue 5 to Bukit Batok in
Singapore but I can't recall which year it was at the moment. Then
from Bukit Batok to Bedok Reservoir Road.

One night in May 2011, I was walking along the street outside Giant
Hypermarket at Toa Payoh Lorong 4, thinking to myself and speaking to
nobody. To my surprise, I heard a voice reiterating my thoughts. I
went home, did a Google search and found out that I am actually a
Targeted Individual! After the discovery that I am actually a Targeted
Individual, government voices tapered off after December 2011.

For a period of five years between 2007 and 2011, I couldn't sustain
and concentrate on my jobs because I was hearing government voices
constantly. After the government voices tapered off after December
2011, I was lost and didn't know what to do for another five years
between 2012 and 2016. I was going into and out of numerous jobs
between 2012 and 2016 as well.

In 2016, I finally decided and made up my mind that I wanted to be an
Information Technology Support Engineer.

Oct 2016: Enrolled into one-year part-time Diploma (conversion) in
Computer Networking course at Singapore Polytechnic.

21 March 2017: Applied for refugee status/political asylum at the
United Nations Refugee Agency in Bangkok, Thailand. The United Nations
Refugee Agency in Bangkok does not operate a refugee shelter and does
not provide financial assistance to refugee seekers. Armed with only
SGD$300, I had to fly back to Singapore the next day on 22 March 2017.
With only SGD$300 left, no hotel in Bangkok, Thailand would allow me
to stay on indefinitely for free. As I have mentioned earlier, there
is no refugee shelter in Thailand and the United Nations Refugee
Agency does not provide financial assistance to refugee seekers.

April 2017 to July 2017: I was working at a systems integrator (SI)
firm in Singapore as an IT support engineer. I resigned in July 2017
because I wanted to spend all my time preparing for the final exams in
August 2017. It would be my very first IT certification and I wanted
to make sure I pass the final exams and get the Diploma in Computer
Networking. It was also the very first time I flew to Taipei, Taiwan
and attended Taiwan Adult Expo in 2017 while I was having a job.

Oct 2017: Graduated from Diploma (conversion) in Computer Networking
course at Singapore Polytechnic with 4 Distinctions and a Grade A for
ET1505 project.

After graduation, I worked part-time at Challenger superstore as a
retail assistant for some time before working as a security guard at
National Library Board at Bugis for 3 months.

Nov 2017: I flew to Tokyo, Japan to attend Japan Adult Expo 2017 and
tried to apply for the role of JAV actor. It was my very first time in
Japan.

Late Nov 2017: After I returned to Singapore from Tokyo, Japan, I
started working for a very small systems integrator (SI) firm in
Singapore as an IT support engineer. I worked in this company for 1
year (12 months). Initially, when I joined this company, salary
payment was on time for the first 2 or 3 months. Subsequently, salary
payment was delayed by 2-3 weeks every month. In the final 2+ months
of my 1 year stay, I couldn't get my salary of about $5000. I had to
chase after my boss almost every day for my outstanding salaries for
close to 2 months. My boss was irritated by my constant chasing and
decided to terminate my employment on 22 Nov 2018 but he asked me to
work for him for another one month. When I still couldn't get my
outstanding salaries, I approached the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)
which told me that I am entitled to resigned without notice if I am
unable to get my salary after 7 days. On 3 December 2018, I proceeded
to resign without notice and filed my salary claim at the Tripartitle
Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM). Both the boss and myself
signed the Settlement Agreement and I had to file the Settlement
Agreement at the State Courts in Singapore. I managed to receive my
outstanding salary of slightly more than $5000 in five monthly
installments until 28 April 2019.

August 2018: Attended Taiwan Adult Expo 2018 and Taipei Red Expo 2018
in Taipei, Taiwan

January 2019: I worked as a Deployment Engineer at National
Environment Agency, Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, in
Singapore before being terminated after only 2 weeks.

I joined another SI company in Singapore as a Senior Technical Support
Engineer on 25 February 2019 under the e2i Career Trial scheme. I was
terminated immediately without notice on 6 June 2019 (Allied D-day).

1-5 August 2019: Attended Taiwan Adult Expo 2019 and Taipei Red Expo
2019 in Taipei, Taiwan. Applied for refugee status/political asylum at
the National Immigration Agency, Ministry of the Interior, Republic of
China (Taiwan) in Taipei on 5 August 2019.

When you become a Targeted Individual, the government will attack you
on all fronts, according to millions of Targeted Individuals all over
the world.

-----BEGIN SECTION A-----

The first thing the government will attack you on is your health.

Let's look at Singaporean Mr. Cheong Wei Chang, who sued Singapore
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in the Supreme Court in Singapore for
*government-induced health problems* and failed job interviews. He
claimed that the prime minister made him shit blood.

Here are 3 news articles on Singaporean Mr. Cheong Wei Chang.

miscellaneous photos relating to a variety of his supposed woes. The
photos and their captions related to topics ranging from failed job
interviews and errors in finance textbooks to health problems.

In the judgment on the case that was released on the Supreme Court=E2=80=99=

website last Friday, it appears that the man, Mr Cheong Wei Chang,

Revealing that the volumes pointed to a wide variety of topics such as
failed job interviews, health issues and errors in finance textbooks,
judicial commissioner Valerie Thean provided three examples of the
issues Mr Cheong attributed to PM Lee, in the judgment. [UNQUOTE]

I am of the opinion that Singaporean Mr. Cheong Wei Chang is also a
Targeted Individual.

Coming back to myself. I have so many medical problems at 41 years
old. Here is the list:

(1) memory problems

(2) eye problems

(3) mild, random, and intermittent chronic chest pain for 10 years,
since about 2009 i think

(4) irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

(5) nutritional deficiency disorder

(6) high cholesterol

(7) high triglycerides

(8) diabetes mellitus

(9) borderline blood pressure

(10) osteoarthritis of both knees (degeneration or wear and tear of knee jo=
ints)

(11) eczema on both feet

Looking at the cases of Singaporean Mr. Cheong Wei Chang and also
Singaporean Mr. Gilbert Louis, I am wondering if all of the above
medical problems were induced by the Singapore Government covertly. I
am suspecting that the Singapore Government covertly gave me so many
medical problems.

Referring to osteoarthritis of both knees, is the Singapore Government
trying to handicap me so that I cannot even work in mediocre
low-paying part time and temporary jobs in Singapore and travel out of
Singapore? Most people develop osteoarthritis of both knees in the
late 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s. I have osteoarthritis too early at 41
years old.

Not forgetting Singaporean Mr. Gilbert Louis, he claimed that the
Singapore Government made him suffer five heart attacks. And of course
Singaporean Mr. Gilbert Louis is a Targeted Individual as well.

according to millions of Targeted Individuals all over the world.

Covertly and subtlely, governments do not allow Targeted Individuals
to have sustainable employment.

Millions of Targeted Individuals all over the world report frequent
termination from employment or frequently forced to resign.

I am no exception. For the past 13 years after graduating from
National University of Singapore in 2007, I have extremely little
employment history. For the past 13 years after graduating from
National University of Singapore in 2007, I was extremely
under-employed and under-achieved. For the past 13 years after
graduating from National University of Singapore in 2007, I was
FREQUENTLY terminated from employment or forced to resign.

Covertly and subtlely, governments do not allow Targeted Individuals
to have sustainable employment.

At 41 years old now, my total CPF savings is only approximately
SGD$66,000 (as at 10 Nov 2019 Sunday). In contrast, Singaporean Mr.
Gerald Tan has some SGD$700,000 in his CPF account. Most of the
average people at my age now would have AT LEAST SGD$300,000 to
SGD$400,000 in their CPF accounts. My extremely low CPF savings of
about SGD$66,000 is a testament to the fact that I have very little
employment history for the past 13 years after graduating from
National University of Singapore in 2007. The Singapore Government
simply do not allow me to have sustainable employment.

Governments also do not allow Targeted Individuals to be financially
independent and earn a lot of money.

Sometime ago, The Straits Times reported that a Singaporean housewife
was cheated of some SGD$700,000 (almost a million dollars).

Recently, Stomp in Singapore reported that a Singaporean man flaunted
SGD$354,000 in his POSB bank account to his Facebook dating partner.

On 8 Oct 2019, I picked up someone's UOB bank ATM slip showing a bank
balance of SGD$67,658.

On 5 Nov 2019 Tuesday, I saw a Caucasian man at Tan Tock Seng Hospital
in Singapore with SGD$264,000 in his bank account. I had a chance to
glimpse at the screen on the ATM machine.

It seems that almost everyone in Singapore is a lot a lot richer than
me while I live in extreme poverty in Singapore.

In stark contrast, my personal savings is mediocre and insignificant.
As of 10 November 2019 Sunday, I have LESS THAN SGD$1800 in my bank
accounts. I can barely survive 3 months with LESS THAN SGD$1800
personal savings.

At 41 years old now, I do not even own a HDB flat! The extremely low
income group in Singapore lives in the most basic HDB 3-room flats.
But I do not even own a HDB 3-room flat! I am now living in a HDB
1-room rental flat (which I do not own obviously) meant for the
extremely poor in Singapore. I live in EXTREME POVERTY in Singapore.

Besides not owning any residential property, I also do not have any
car. In addition, I have never had any credit cards for the past 41
years of my life.

I live in EXTREME POVERTY in Singapore and I simply love to flaunt my
poverty! I am still STRUGGLING to find mediocre low-paying part time
and temporary jobs in Singapore to feed myself while a foreign
expatriate from India, who is a manager director in JP Morgan in
Singapore, earns SGD$66,333 per month. I am STRUGGLING to earn SGD$7
to SGD$15 per hour in mediocre low-paying part time and temporary jobs
in Singapore. I heard that the foreign expat who earns SGD$66,333 per
month in Singapore only has a university degree from Hull University.
It seems that Hull University is ranked 500th to 600th in the world
while I have a university degree from the National University of
Singapore with 2 polytechnic diplomas!

Therefore, Governments do not allow Targeted Individuals to be
financially independent and earn a lot of money.

Most Singaporeans travel overseas *frequently every year* but I have
only made a MEDIOCRE number of overseas trips for the past 41 years of
my life.

Many photographers in Singapore are able to spend at least SGD$500 to
SGD$600 every month in joining organized model photoshoots while I can
only spend SGD$60 to SGD$70 every 3 or 4 months or perhaps even
longer.

At my age, with my education, caliber and infocomms technology (ICT)
skillset, I should be able to earn at least SGD$9000 per month as
manager, senior manager, or director. But I live in extreme poverty in
Singapore.

Since 5 December 2018, I have attended 22 FAILED job interviews so
far. At my most recent 22nd job interview at HCL Insys Pte Ltd on 6
Nov 2019 Wednesday, I told the interviewer Mr. Raju that my
application for Top Secret security clearance was rejected 13 years
ago in 2007 while I was working for DSTA. Mr. Raju told me that
there's a very high chance that my application for security clearance
would be rejected again should I want to work for HCL Insys Pte Ltd as
a Desktop Support Engineer Level 2. He says that my records at MSD or
ISD would not go away in 5, 10 or even 50 years. Mr. Raju frankly told
me not to waste my time applying for government jobs which require
security clearance as I would never be successful. He advised me to
tell recruitment consultants from recruitment agencies that I am not
interested in government jobs in Singapore which require security
clearance. HCL Insys Pte Ltd works closely with the Government of
Singapore in government projects.

The final topic I am going to touch on is that the Singapore
Government is also trying to prevent me from enjoying my hobby. I am a
hobbyist photographer and videographer who loves to take photos and
videos of show girls, models, talents, cosplayers and celebrities in
car shows, tech shows, trade shows, cosplay conventions, celebrities
meet-and-greet and other events in Singapore.

When you become a Targeted Individual, one of the most common things
the government will do to you is to spread rumours about you.
Governments will launch rumour-mongering campaigns against Targeted
Individuals with the help of secret government operatives.

Textbook for Targeted Individuals published by Targeted Individuals
Europe (or Targeted Individuals in European Countries). The link is

I think the Singapore Government has spread so many rumours about me
that many show girls, models, talents and some cosplayers in Singapore
do not allow me to take photos and videos of them.

The second reason why many show girls, models, talents and some
cosplayers in Singapore refuse to let me take photos and videos of
them is because the Singapore Government had probably passed down
orders and instructions to them telling them not to allow me to take
photos and videos of them.

The third reason why many show girls, models, talents and some
cosplayers in Singapore refuse to let me take photos and videos of
them is because of self-censorship. It is because I am a Targeted
Individual. A Targeted Individual is a person who is persecuted,
targeted and marked by the government. So these show girls, models,
talents and cosplayers are afraid of having photos and videos taken by
me. In a The Online Citizen Singapore (TOCSG) article which I can't
seem to find now, a Singaporean manager was reported to be very afraid
of taking photos together with the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP)
chairman Paul Tambyah and requested for these photos to be deleted.
The Singaporean manager claimed that he was afraid for his future and
worried about his rice bowl. He is afraid that he would be marked by
the Singapore Government. SDP is one of the many Opposition political
parties in Singapore. It is a well known fact that millions of
Singaporeans are afraid of taking photos together with Opposition
political figures for fear of being marked by the PAP government in
Singapore. I am a Targeted Individual, so naturally many show girls,
models, talents and some cosplayers practiced self-censorship,
refusing to let me take photos and videos of them.

The last reason why many show girls, models, talents and some
cosplayers in Singapore refuse to let me take photos and videos of
them is because of my extreme poverty in Singapore. I have nothing to
offer them.

Out of millions and millions of visitors and photographers to car
shows, tech shows, and trade shows in Singapore, I am the one and only
person who is not allowed to take photos and videos of the show girls,
models and talents.

I have never joined Troy Tham Guang Xiong's organized model
photoshoots in Singapore before, but he has blocked me from joining
his organized model photoshoots. Actually there is no need for Troy
Tham Guang Xiong to ban me from joining his organized model
photoshoots, because I have no money to join his organized model
photoshoots! I live in extreme poverty in Singapore.

I live in extreme poverty in Singapore. I simply love to flaunt my
poverty! That's why I have applied to set world records at Guinness
World Records, but they were mostly rejected probably due to influence
from the Singapore Government.

Here is the list of world records which I have attempted to set at
Guiness World Records.
