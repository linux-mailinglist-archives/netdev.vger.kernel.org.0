Dearest  Beloved.

I am Mrs. Gottfried S. Kathleen, I decided to donate what I have to
you for investment towards the good work of charity organization, and
qlso to help the motherless and the less privileged ones and to carry
out a charitable works in your Country and around the World on my
Behalf.

I am diagnosing of throat Cancer, hospitalize for good 2 years and
some months now and quite obvious that I have few days to live, and I
am a Widow no child; I decided to will/donate the sum of $7.8 million
to you for the good work of God, and also to help the motherless
endless privilege and also forth assistance of the widows. At the
moment I cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the fact
that my relatives (that have squandered the funds for this purpose
before) are round me and my health status also. I have adjusted my
will and my Bank is aware.

I have willed those properties to you by quoting my Personal File
Routing and Account Information. And I have also notified the bank
that I am willing that properties to you for a good effective and
prudent work. It is right to say that I have been directed to do this
by God. I will be going in for a surgery soon and I want to make sure
that I make this donation before undergoing this surgery.

I will need your support to make this dream come through, could you
let me know your interest to enable me give you further information.
Thanks
Yours Sick Sister in Christ.
Mrs. Gottfried S. Kathleen
