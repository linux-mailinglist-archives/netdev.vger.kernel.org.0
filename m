I'm not sure if TX-only SCO link is possible. I always thought that SCO
is synchronous bidirectional link.

As I said, this "workaround" is useful for classic bluetooth headsets
and is it possible to use it immediately without any kernel changes.

And I agree that kernel should tell userspace correct MTU value. And
this should be fixed. "Workaround" is useful for immediate action to
deliver at least something which works with most bluetooth headsets.

I think this startup latency is negligible in HFP profile where start
needs non-trivial exchange of AT commands.

That is a good question for some research. I remember that e.g.
pulseaudio used this technique for synchronizing bluetooth SCO RX and TX
streams.
