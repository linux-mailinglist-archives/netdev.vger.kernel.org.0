That's right, thanks for pointing this out! I'll fix it for v4.

We actually do not use directly the base_addr anymore from within the
driver, thanks to the shared package conversion. We're now using
__phy_package_write/__phy_package_read which are using the base address.

So the move could be to remove it from the vsc8531_private. If we were
to do it, we would need to find a clean solution: it's still part of a
structure as multiple values are computed in vsc8584_get_base_addr, and
it's a lot easier and cleaner to have them all in the same struct. Also,
that have nothing to do with the current series :)

Thanks,
Antoine
