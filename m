There are stats "mainly errors*"  that are not even visible or reported
to the user prog, for that i had an idea in the past to attach an
exception_bpf_prog provided by the user, where driver/stack will report
errors to this special exception_prog.

XDP is going to always be eBPF based ! why not just report such stats
to a special BPF_MAP ? BPF stack can collect the stats from the driver
and report them to this special MAP upon user request.
