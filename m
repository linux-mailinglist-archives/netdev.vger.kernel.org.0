I don't think that's the question Jakub is asking.  As I understand it,
if you send a MSG_OOB on a TCP socket and the receiver calls recvmsg(),
it will see MSG_OOB set, even if SO_OOBINLINE is set.  That wouldn't
happen with Unix sockets.  I'm OK with that difference in behaviour,
because MSG_OOB on Unix sockets _is not_ for sending out of band data.
It's just for sending an urgent signal.

As you say, MSG_OOB does not require data to be sent for unix sockets
(unlike TCP which always requires at least one byte), but one can
choose to send data as part of a message which has MSG_OOB set.  It
won't be tagged in any special way.

To Jakub's other question, we could require SO_OOBINLINE to be set.
That'd provide another layer of insurance against applications being
surprised by a SIGURG they weren't expecting.  I don't know that it's
really worth it though.

One thing I wasn't clear about, and maybe you know, if we send a MSG_OOB,
does this patch cause this part of the tcp(7) manpage to be true for
unix sockets too?

       When out-of-band data is present, select(2) indicates the file descrip‚Äê
       tor as having an exceptional condition and poll (2) indicates a POLLPRI
       event.
