My greeting to you and your family,
I am Captain JAMES WILLIAMS. I'm 49 years old, from the united states, 
but I am currently in Syria for peace keeping mission. I am the 
commanding officer of the third Battalion soldier regime.

Please forgive my manners I am not good when it comes to the Internet 
because that is not really my field.

I came across your email confidently when I was searching for a 
reliable person and I suddenly got your email address and I guess it's 
for a good purpose,here in Syria we are not allowed to go out that 
makes it very bored for me so I just think I need a friend to talk to 
outside to keep me going. I would love to get to know you as a friend.

Where are you from I will like to know more about you.

Respectfully,
James Williams
