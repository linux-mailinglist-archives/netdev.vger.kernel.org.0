I believe itâ€™s an implicit built-in rule, which is defined by make
itself here:

https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/make.git/tree/default.c?h=4.2.1#n131

The observed behavior arises because these rules use $^ all over the
place. My 2c is that it would be better to make the rule explicit,
because it would cost just an extra line, but it would be immediately
obvious why the code is correct w.r.t. rebuilds.

Best regards,
Ilya
