That is correct.

The "scanning" boolean is stored as a wpan_phy member (IIRC) so we
should be good on this regard (now that I have a clearer picture of the
dependencies).

I forgot about this path. Indeed I'll add a check in the transmit path
as well, of course.

So it cannot do an active scan, but a passive scan would be allowed
(there is no transmission, and the beacons are regular valid frames,
I suppose they should not be filtered out by the hardware).

So we actually need these hooks back :-) Because the right thing to do
here is to use the "FYI here is the scan op that is starting" message
from the mac to the drivers and this driver should return "nope,
-ENOTSUPP". The mac would react in this case by canceling the
operation and returning an error to the caller. Same when sending
beacons if we consider beacons as !dataframes.
