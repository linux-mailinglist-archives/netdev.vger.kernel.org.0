Nice work!

This looks more comprehensive, although regarding check_phy_write(),
my understanding is that you checked cross-reads and cross-writes with
only one register: priv->read_reg is implicitly 0 during the
do_reg_work() -> check_phy_write() call sequence, so that register is
probably PORT0_CGST_HALF_CFG.

Anyway, if Realtek's description is that "if a read fails, the value
read back will be the result of the last successful read", then it's
probably not suprising that cross-reads and cross-writes don't make the
indirect PHY write fail (since there's no register read). I don't have
the background of what is the OCP, but the implication of the above
paragraph seems to be that an indirect PHY read is in essence the read
of a single register, which gets aborted when a read of any other
register except RTL8365MB_INDIRECT_ACCESS_STATUS_REG or
RTL8365MB_INDIRECT_ACCESS_READ_DATA_REG gets initiated.
