Good day!

My name is Martial Akakapo, a personal lawyer to late Mr, Robert
Wilson, who used to worked with an oil servicing company here in
Republic of Lome, .my client and his family was killed in Kenya
shopping mall attack At least 67 people died when gunmen from terror
group  AL-Shabaab laid siege to the East-gate shopping center in
Nairobi.Kenya.. i have made several inquiries to locate any of his
relatives but have been  unsuccessful

I am contacting you to assist in the repatriation of funds worth  $3
million dollars before it is confiscated by the bank. The bank  has
issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or the account will be
confiscated, I seek your consent to present you as next of Kin,
Affidavit it on your name and so you can claim this huge amount he
left. As soon as I hear from you I will let you know more detailed
information regarding this transaction.

Thanks
