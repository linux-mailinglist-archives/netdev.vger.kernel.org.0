I have two additional things to take into account:
* phy_reset_after_clk_enable() shoulnd't be longer called that way since 
it is now misleading -> the phy is no longer reset after clock enable but 
during hw_init()
* how about fec_resume()? I don't think hw_init() is called then and so 
phy_reset_after_clk_enable() will no longer be called.
