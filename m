The Linux mctp-i2c endpoint (0xMM) can send MCTP messages to any I2C node
(0xNN), as a block write master->slave. The MCTP I2C transport is
bidirectional - either side can send the first message, all messages are
block writes. (Hopefully I've understood your question)

Most higher level protocols on top of MCTP are request/response style, though
it isn't inherent. The mctp-i2c driver is mostly stateless, but it in order
to deal with i2c muxes the MCTP stack has a concept of "flows" so that it
will keep a bus locked for replies after sending out a request (with timeout)
- that matches how higherÂ level protocols expect to work.

Yes, it's really only useful for debugging since it could be outdated by the
time it is read. I'll remove it, we could add something more robust if people
had a need.
