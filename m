Thanks for fixing this.

but I don't think the bug was introduced by this commit, because there
are already calls to cgroup_sk_alloc_disable() in write_priomap() and
write_classid(), which can be triggered by writing to ifpriomap or
classid in cgroupfs. This commit just made it much easier to happen
with systemd invovled.

I think it's 4bfc0bb2c60e2f4c ("bpf: decouple the lifetime of cgroup_bpf from cgroup itself"),
which added cgroup_bpf_get() in cgroup_sk_alloc().
