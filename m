None of this allows you to distinguish between 1000BASE-X, SGMII and
QSGMII, which is what the commit message says.

It does allow you to get duplex, pause, and maybe speed via in band
signalling. But you should also be getting the same information out of
band, via the phylib callback.

There are some MACs which don't seem to work correctly without the in
band signalling, so maybe that is your problem? Please could you give
more background about your problem, what MAC and PHY combination are
you using, what problem you are seeing, etc.
