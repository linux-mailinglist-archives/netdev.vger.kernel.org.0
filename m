Hello,

today bpf2bpf calls and tailcalls exclude each other. This set is a
proposal to make them work together. It is still a RFC because we need
to decide if the performance impact for BPF programs with tailcalls is
acceptable or not. Note that I have been focused only on x86
architecture, I am not sure if other architectures have some other
restrictions that were stopping us to have tailcalls in BPF subprograms.

I would also like to get a feedback on prog_array_map_poke_run changes.

To give you an overview how this work started, previously I posted RFC
that was targetted at getting rid of push/pop instructions for callee
saved registers in x86-64 JIT that are not used by the BPF program.
Alexei saw a potential that that work could be lifted a bit and
tailcalls could work with BPF subprograms. More on that in [1], [2].

In [1], Alexei says:

"The prologue will look like:
nop5
xor eax,eaxÂ  // two new bytes if bpf_tail_call() is used in this
function
push rbp
mov rbp, rsp
sub rsp, rounded_stack_depth
push rax // zero init tail_call counter
variable number of push rbx,r13,r14,r15

Then bpf_tail_call will pop variable number rbx,..
and final 'pop rax'
Then 'add rsp, size_of_current_stack_frame'
jmp to next function and skip over 'nop5; xor eax,eax; push rpb; mov
rbp, rsp'

This way new function will set its own stack size and will init tail
call counter with whatever value the parent had.

If next function doesn't use bpf_tail_call it won't have 'xor eax,eax'.
Instead it would need to have 'nop2' in there."

So basically I gave a shot at that suggestion. Patch 4 has a description
of implementation.

Quick overview of patches:
Patch 1 changes BPF retpoline to use %rcx instead of %rax to store
address of BPF tailcall target program
Patch 2 relaxes verifier's restrictions about tailcalls being used with
BPF subprograms
Patch 3 propagates poke descriptors from main program to each subprogram
Patch 4 is the main dish in this set. It implements new prologue layout
that was suggested by Alexei and reworks tailcall handling.
Patch 5 is the new selftest that proves tailcalls can be used from
within BPF subprogram.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Debatable prog_array_map_poke_run changes:

Before the tailcall and with the new prologue layout, stack need to be
unwinded and callee saved registers need to be popped. Instructions
responsible for that are generated, but they should not be executed if
target program is not present. To address that, new poke target 'ip_aux'
is introduced to poke descriptor that will be used for skipping these
instructions. This means there are two poke targets for handling direct
tailcalls. Simplified flow can be presented as three sections:

1. skip call or nop (poke->ip_aux)
2. stack unwind
3. call tail or nop (poke->ip)

It would be possible that one of CPU might be in point 2 and point 3 is
not yet updated (nop), which would lead to problems mentioned in patch 4
commit message, IOW unwind section should not be executed if there is no
target program.

We can define the following state matrix for that (courtesy of Bjorn):
A nop, unwind, nop
B nop, unwind, tail
C skip, unwind, nop
D skip, unwind, tail

A is forbidden (lead to incorrectness). C is the starting state. What if
we just make sure we *never* enter than state, and never return to C?

First install tail call f: C->D->B(f)
 * poke the tailcall, after that get rid of the skip
Update tail call f to f': B(f)->B(f')
 * poke the tailcall (poke->ip) and do NOT touch the poke->ip_aux
Remove tail call: B(f')->D(f')
 * do NOT touch poke->ip, only poke the poke->ip_aux. Note that we do
   not get back to C(f')
Install new tail call (f''): D(f')->D(f'')->B(f'').
 * poke both targets, first ->ip then ->ip_aux

So, by avoiding A and never going back to C another CPU can never be
exposed to the "unwind, tail" state.

Right now, due to 'faking' the bpf_arch_text_poke,
prog_array_map_poke_run looks a bit messy. I dropped the 'old' argument
usage at all and instead I do the reverse calculation that is being done
by emit_patch, so that the result of memcmp(ip, old_insn, X86_PATCH_SIZE)
is 0 and we do the actual poking.

Presumably this is something to be fixed/improved, but at first, I would
like to hear opinions of others and have some decision whether it is worth
pursuing, or not.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance impact:

As requested, I'm including the performance numbers that show an
impact of that set, but I did not analyze it. Let's do this on list.
Also, please let me know if these scenarios make sense and are
sufficient.

All of this work, as stated in [2], started as a way to speed up AF-XDP
by dropping the push/pop of unused callee saved registers in prologue
and epilogue. Impact is positive, 15% of performance gain.

However, it is obvious that it will have a negative impact on BPF
programs that utilize tailcalls. I was asked to provide some numbers
that will tell us how much actually are theses cases damaged by this
set.

Below are te numbers from 'perf stat' for two scenarios.
First scenario is the output of command:

$ sudo perf stat -ddd -r 1024 ./test_progs -t tailcalls

tailcalls kselftest was modified in a following way:
- only taicall1 subtest is enabled
- each of the bpf_prog_test_run() calls got set 'repeat' argument to
  1000000

Numbers without this set:
