Correct; completely unrelated to the notion of "interface index."

The pppd source base is old.  It dates to the mid-80's.  So it predates 
not just rename-able interfaces in Linux but Linux itself.

I recall supported platforms in the past (BSD-derived) that didn't 
support allowing the user to specify the unit number.  In general, on 
those platforms, the option was accepted and just ignored, and there 
were either release notes or man page updates (on that platform) that 
indicated that "unit N" wouldn't work there.

Are there users on Linux who make use of the "unit" option and who would 
mourn its loss?  Nobody really knows.  It's an ancient feature that was 
originally intended to deal with systems that couldn't rename interfaces 
(where one had to make sure that the actual interface selected matched 
up with pre-configured filtering rules or static routes or the like), 
and to make life nice for administrators (e.g., making sure that serial 
port 1 maps to ppp1, port 2 is ppp2, and so on).

I would think and hope most users reach for the more-flexible "ifname" 
option first, but I certainly can't guarantee it.  It could be buried in 
a script somewhere or (god forbid) some kind of GUI or "usability" tool.

If I were back at Sun, I'd probably call it suitable only for a "Major" 
release, as it removes a publicly documented feature.  But I don't know 
what the considerations are here.  Maybe it's just a "don't really care."
