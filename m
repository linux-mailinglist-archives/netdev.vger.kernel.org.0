Subject: [PATCH] drivers: net: Fix Kconfig indentation, continued
Date:   Thu, 21 Nov 2019 21:28:28 +0800
Message-Id: <20191121132828.28828-1-krzk@kernel.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1
Sender: netdev-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <netdev.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: netdev@vger.kernel.org

Adjust indentation from spaces to tab (+optional two spaces) as in
coding style.  This fixes various indentation mixups (seven spaces,
tab+one space, etc).
