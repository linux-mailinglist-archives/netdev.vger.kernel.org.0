Yes, I started off with TCP but wondering if it is applicable to the
others too as the 'problem' sounds really generic to me.

Keeping the if statement as it is would imply the prot pressure as a
master 'switch' to all kinds of pressure. IMHO this might hurt other
protocols with pressure enabled if they are all used in one memcg which
happens to be under vmpressure, IOW UDP allocations are given higher
priority than others.

Yes.. And it starts to get me confused that why&when should the memcg
pressure be used given that we don't want to put harsh constrains on
sockmem even under memcg pressure.

Thanks!
