Yup sorry that's not what I meant: the kernel robot detected that a
patch broke the build. This patch was part of the current series. The
issue was that I messed a copy paste error. But I didn't ran a
per-patch build test and another patch, which had nothing to do with
this fix, actually addressed the build issue. I very likely failed
something during my rebase operation.

So yes, this series should come first. Then we'll tackle the symbol
duration series, the Kconfig cleanup and after that we can start thick
topics :)

Yes of course, you've been very (very) reactive so far, I try to be
also more reactive on my side but that's of course not a race!

Thanks,
