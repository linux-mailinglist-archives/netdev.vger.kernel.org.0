Hi Martin,

Thank you very much for your comments. I have indeed removed global 
negotiator from my latest implementation.

The latest design is that users can register a negotiator implementation 
indexed by name, smc_sock can use bpf_setsockopt to specify
whether a specific negotiation implementation is required via name. If 
there are no settings, there will be no negotiators.

What do you think?

In addition, I am very sorry that I have not issued my implementation 
for such a long time, and I have encountered some problems with the 
implementation because
the SMC needs to be built as kernel module, I have struggled with the 
bpf_setsockopt implementation, and there are some new self-testes that 
need to be written.

However, I believe that I can send a new version as soon as possible.


Best wishes
D. Wythe
