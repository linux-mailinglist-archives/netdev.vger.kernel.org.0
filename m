Actually, not so many drivers are impacted:

| $ grep -R atomic_t drivers/net/can/
| drivers/net/can/c_can/c_can.h:  atomic_t sie_pending;
| drivers/net/can/usb/esd_usb2.c: atomic_t active_tx_jobs;
| drivers/net/can/usb/ems_usb.c:  atomic_t active_tx_urbs;
| drivers/net/can/usb/gs_usb.c:   atomic_t active_tx_urbs;
| drivers/net/can/usb/gs_usb.c:   atomic_t active_channels;
| drivers/net/can/usb/mcba_usb.c: atomic_t free_ctx_cnt;
| drivers/net/can/usb/usb_8dev.c: atomic_t active_tx_urbs;
| drivers/net/can/usb/peak_usb/pcan_usb_core.h:   atomic_t active_tx_urbs;
| drivers/net/can/usb/etas_es58x/es58x_core.h:    atomic_t tx_urbs_idle_cnt;
| drivers/net/can/usb/etas_es58x/es58x_core.c:    atomic_t *idle_cnt =
&es58x_dev->tx_urbs_idle_cnt;

The only relevant one seems to be the gs_usb with its atomic_t
active_channels. I looked at the code, the change to u8 shouldnâ€™t
be too hard. But aside from that, I am also concerned by the
absence of an exit path in gs_can_open() to free the allocated
URB memory when an error occurs.

I will send a patch to change the active_channels from
atomic_t to u8, however, I will not rework the error path to
free the allocated URB memory.

Also, we need to double check that none of the drivers uses a
spinlock or mutex in their open() or close() functions. I gave it
a first glance and didn't find anything outstanding but I will
need to spend a bit of extra time on that to confirm.


Yours sincerely,
Vincent Mailhol
