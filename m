Hi Greg,

I was going by this bit of the comment on ida_destroy:

   * Calling this function frees all IDs and releases all resources used
   * by an IDA.  When this call returns, the IDA is empty and can be reused
   * or freed.  If the IDA is already empty, there is no need to call this
   * function.

[From a documentation improvement in 50d97d50715]

Looking at ida_destroy, it's iterating the xarray and freeing all !value
entries. ida_free will free a (allocated) value entry once all bits are
clear, so the comment looks correct to me - there's nothing left to free
if the ida is empty.

However, I'm definitely no ida/idr/xarray expert! Happy to be corrected
here - and I'll send a patch to clarify that comment too, if so.

Cheers,


Jeremy
