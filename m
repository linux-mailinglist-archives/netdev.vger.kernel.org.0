My bad. I did not look at it correctly. I made a mistake when talking
about a hardMAC.

Instead, it is a "custom" low level MAC layer. I believe we can compare
the current mac802154 layer mostly to the MLME that is mentioned in the
spec. Well here the additional layer that needs these hooks would be
the MCPS. I don't know if this will be upstreamed or not, but the need
for these hooks is real if such an intermediate low level MAC layer
gets introduced.

In v2 I will get rid of the two patches adding "driver access" to scans
and beacons in order to facilitate the merge of the big part. Then we
will have plenty of time to discuss how we can create such an interface.
Perhaps I'll be able to propose more code as well to make use of these
hooks, we will see.

Yes, this is likely to happen quickly because of robots :)
