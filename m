Just a bunch of questions.

Actually, why is it necessary to have a full MDIO bus scan already 
during probing peripherals?

If during probing the peripherals enable their resources (like clocks), 
what's wrong in having the full MDIO bus scan after probing of all 
peripherals is complete (and all peripherals are up)?

Also, what's wrong in letting the MDIO bus scan find only some PHYs in 
the first go, and then letting each driver instance (of particular 
peripheral) initiate scan only for its specific PHY, if it was not found 
yet?
(Is it thatof_mdio.h provides public function of_mdiobus_register, but 
not something similar to add only specific devices/phys without 
destroying the existing state?)
I'd say that it is not necessary to have a PHY getting found before it 
is needed to setup the complete interface.

Best regards,
Adam
