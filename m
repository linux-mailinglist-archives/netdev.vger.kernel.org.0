No problem, in case you still want to know about BTCOEX:

 From what I've seen that's not something defined in any standards, but
it's usually the name of the (sometimes patented) tricks every manufacturer
has to make wifi and bt (which are both on the 2.4ghz band) behave well
together.

In almost every wifi driver you'll find functionality named
btcoex/coexist/coexistence. The way it usually works is that the card
sends an event to the kernel driver (in our case that event is called
BTCOEX), and then the driver decides which quirks to apply to make wifi
more interference-resistant (here's where the patents come in because
some of those quirks are quite tricky, see for example
https://patents.google.com/patent/US9226102B1/en).

Now with our Marvell card the firmware is buggy and sends those events
so unreliably (the card "forgets" to inform us that the BT connection
has ended) that we're better off ignoring them.
