My Dear friend,

With all due respect, I know this message will come to you as a
surprise, My name is Mr. Mohammad Ahmed a banker working with Bank of
Africa  Du  Burkina Faso West Africa, i need your urgent assistance to
transfer an abandoned Sum of 13.5 Millions USD into your account.

I am contacting you independently of my investigation in my bank and
no one is informed of this communication. I need your urgent
assistance in transferring the sum of $13.5million dollars to Your
private account, The Fund in question belongs to one of our late
foreign customer who died a longtime ago with his family together with
his supposed NEXT OF KIN since the year 2005 in the plane crash.

The Fund has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without
anybody coming for the claim of it as the deceased relation.

I want to release the money to you as the relative to our  late
deceased customer, the Banking laws here does not allow such money to
stay more than 16years, because the money will be recalled to the Bank
Treasury account as unclaimed fund. I am ready to share with you 50%
for you and 50% for me and by indicating your interest I will send you
the full details on how the business will be executed without any
hitch.

 I will be waiting for your urgent response.

Thanks.

Best Regards,


Mr. Mohammad Ahmed
