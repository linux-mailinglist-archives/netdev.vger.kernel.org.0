I like the idea but I'm not sure on what side you want to tackle the
problem first. Is it the phy drivers which should advertise the mac
about the promiscuous mode they support (which matches the description
below but does not fit the purpose of an enum very well)? Or is it the
MAC that requests a particular filtering mode? In this case what a phy
driver should do if:
- the requested mode is more constrained than its usual promiscuous
  capabilities?
- the requested mode is less constrained than its usual promiscuous
  capabilities?

Isn't it the opposite: The filtering level the mac is requesting? Here
it looks like we are describing driver capabilities (ie what drivers
advertise supporting).

I suppose this would be for a sniffer accepting all frames, including
the bad ones.

This means that the driver should only discard bad frames and propagate
all the remaining frames, right? So this typically is a regular sniffer
mode.

I believe what you call mib.PromiscuousMode is the mode that is
referred in the spec, ie. being in the official promiscuous mode? So
that is the mode that should be used "by default" when really asking
for a 802154 promiscuous mode.

Is there really a need for a different mode than mode_1 ?

And here what is the difference between MODE_1 and MODE_3 ?

I suppose here we should as well drop all non-beacon frames?

This is a bit counter intuitive, but do we agree on the fact that the
higher level of filtering should refer to promiscuous = false?
