I've looked at the emac bindings that have phy-supply, and don't see reason
why this can't be generic for the phy. Just like there's generic reset
properties for phys, now. Some bindings, like fsl-fec.txt even list
custom reset properties for phy as deprecated, and recommend using
generic ones.

From the point of the view of the emac driver, it just wants to power on/power
off the phy, and wait until it's ready to be communicated with.

It's probably better to have power supplies of the phy covered by generic
phy code, because then you don't have to duplicate all this special power
up logic in every emac driver, whenever a HW designer decides to combine
such emac with external phy that requires some special hadnling on powerup.

At the moment, this lack of flexibility is hacked around by adding multiple
regulators to the DTS, and making them dependent on each other (even if one
doesn't supply the other), just because this makes the regulator core driver
enable them all. Power up delays for the PHY are described as enable-ramp-delays
on the regulators (actual regulator ramp delay + wait time for PHY to initialize).

Basically just hacking the DT so that the Linux kernel in the end does what's
necessary, instead of DT describing the actual HW.

Adding a single supply property to the phy node, as you suggest will do nothing
to help this situation. It will just result in a more complicated dwmac-sun8i
driver and will not help anyone in the future.

So I think, maybe phy powerup should be moved to generic code, just like the
phy reset code was. Generic code can have multiple supplies and some generic
way to specify power up order and timings.

But I guess, this patch series is a dead end.

Understood. So maybe the solution suggested above would improve the situation
eventually?
