Hm, so bpftool or libbpf has some source-address (offset) mapping
APIs, that will help for me.

BTW, I would like to confirm that if the kernel has jited code,
it will not fall back to xlated code. Is it correct?

OK, anyway, I've done the nested kprobe support on x86/arm/arm64 :)
That will make it easy.
