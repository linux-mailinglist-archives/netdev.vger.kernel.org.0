This series provides the Microchip Sparx5 Switch Driver

The Sparx5 Carrier Ethernet and Industrial switch family delivers 64
Ethernet ports and up to 200 Gbps of switching bandwidth.

It provides a rich set of Ethernet switching features such as hierarchical
QoS, hardware-based OAM  and service activation testing, protection
switching, IEEE 1588, and Synchronous Ethernet.

Using provider bridging (Q-in-Q) and MPLS/MPLS-TP technology, it delivers
MEF CE
2.0 Ethernet virtual connections (EVCs) and features advanced TCAM
  classification in both ingress and egress.

Per-EVC features include advanced L3-aware classification, a rich set of
statistics, OAM for end-to-end performance monitoring, and dual-rate
policing and shaping.

Time sensitive networking (TSN) is supported through a comprehensive set of
features including frame preemption, cut-through, frame replication and
elimination for reliability, enhanced scheduling: credit-based shaping,
time-aware shaping, cyclic queuing, and forwarding, and per-stream policing
and filtering.

Together with IEEE 1588 and IEEE 802.1AS support, this guarantees
low-latency deterministic networking for Fronthaul, Carrier, and Industrial
Ethernet.

The Sparx5 switch family consists of following SKUs:

- VSC7546 Sparx5-64 up to 64 Gbps of bandwidth with the following primary
  port configurations:
  - 6 *10G
  - 16 * 2.5G + 2 * 10G
  - 24 * 1G + 4 * 10G

- VSC7549 Sparx5-90 up to 90 Gbps of bandwidth with the following primary
  port configurations:
  - 9 * 10G
  - 16 * 2.5G + 4 * 10G
  - 48 * 1G + 4 * 10G

- VSC7552 Sparx5-128 up to 128 Gbps of bandwidth with the following primary
  port configurations:
  - 12 * 10G
  - 16 * 2.5G + 8 * 10G
  - 48 * 1G + 8 * 10G

- VSC7556 Sparx5-160 up to 160 Gbps of bandwidth with the following primary
  port configurations:
  - 16 * 10G
  - 10 * 10G + 2 * 25G
  - 16 * 2.5G + 10 * 10G
  - 48 * 1G + 10 * 10G

- VSC7558 Sparx5-200 up to 200 Gbps of bandwidth with the following primary
  port configurations:
  - 20 * 10G
  - 8 * 25G

In addition, the device supports one 10/100/1000/2500/5000 Mbps
SGMII/SerDes node processor interface (NPI) Ethernet port.

The Sparx5 support is developed on the PCB134 and PCB135 evaluation boards.

- PCB134 main networking features:
  - 12x SFP+ front 10G module slots (connected to Sparx5 through SFI).
  - 8x SFP28 front 25G module slots (connected to Sparx5 through SFI high
    speed).
  - Optional, one additional 10/100/1000BASE-T (RJ45) Ethernet port
    (on-board VSC8211 PHY connected to Sparx5 through SGMII).

- PCB135 main networking features:
  - 48x1G (10/100/1000M) RJ45 front ports using 12xVSC8514 QuadPHYâ€™s each
    connected to VSC7558 through QSGMII.
  - 4x10G (1G/2.5G/5G/10G) RJ45 front ports using the AQR407 10G QuadPHY
    each port connects to VSC7558 through SFI.
  - 4x SFP28 25G module slots on back connected to VSC7558 through SFI high
    speed.
  - Optional, one additional 1G (10/100/1000M) RJ45 port using an on-board
    VSC8211 PHY, which can be connected to VSC7558 NPI port through SGMII
    using a loopback add-on PCB)

This series provides support for:
  - SFPs and DAC cables via PHYLINK with a number of 5G, 10G and 25G
    devices and media types.
  - Port module configuration for 10M to 25G speeds with SGMII, QSGMII,
    1000BASEX, 2500BASEX and 10GBASER as appropriate for these modes.
  - SerDes configuration via the Sparx5 SerDes driver (see below).
  - Host mode providing register based injection and extraction.
  - Switch mode providing MAC/VLAN table learning and Layer2 switching
    offloaded to the Sparx5 switch.
  - STP state, VLAN support, host/bridge port mode, Forwarding DB, and
    configuration and statistics via ethtool.

More support will be added at a later stage.

The series depends on the following series currently on their way
into the kernel:

- Sparx5 SerDes Driver
  Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20201211090541.157926-1-steen.hegelund@microchip.com/

- Sparx5 Reset Driver
  Link: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210114162432.3039657-1-steen.hegelund@microchip.com/

The 100 Base-X mode is being added to the kernel with this series:

ChangeLog:
    v3:
        - Updated the bindings with
            - adding maxItems: 1 to the port properties in general.
            - mac-address property added
            - sd-gpio property added
            - phy-mode is now required
        - Main module
            - Reworked the driver probe to have 3 stages:
                - Initalization, DT parsing and creating SerDes instances
                - Mapping IO targets
                - Creating ports using DT information and further
                  switch initialization.
            - Wrapped long lines to fit to 80 chars (netdev style)
            - Reworking the switch RAM initialization
            - Made the target table const
            - Return -EINVAL if no coreclock was found.
            - Applied the Reverse Christmas Tree pattern to several
              functions
            - Changes to DT properties:
                - max-speed changed to bandwidth
                - phy-mode is required
            - Removed the reset postcore_initcall code (will be provided in
              a reset driver, see link above)
            - Requesting the reset driver and using that for resetting the
              switch core.
            - Using a bool (has_sfp) to determine if an SFP is available
              for the particular port and removing the sparx5_use_cu_phy
              function.
            - For the basic driver patch: added comments to indicate where
              subsequent patches will be adding more functionality.
        - Netdev module
            - Increment Ethernet addresses correctly.
            - Removed  ether_setup() call.
        - Packet module
            - Used error codes instead of -1.
        - Phylink module
            - Include autoneg and pause when detecting port config changes
        - Port module
            - Added decode_* status functions
            - Removed the preliminary 100fx functionality.  There is
              phylink support on the way for 100 Base-X (see link above),
              so when that is available the 100fx mode will be added again.
            - Made the taxi dist table constant
            - Using named symbols in autoneg decoding
        - MAC table module
            - Removed inline from functions.
            - Changed the default aging to BR_DEFAULT_AGEING_TIME
        - Ethtool module
            - Removed the mutex. Copy statistic on request. Updating time
              is 1s.
        - Device tree
            - Added reset controller properties
        - Common
            - Remove the inclusion of the sparx5_main_regs.h in the
              sparx5_main.h

    v2:
        - The driver patch has been split into 6 patches by functionality
          like this:
            - the basic sparx5 driver
            - hostmode with phylink support
            - port module support
            - switching, vlan and mactable support
            - calendar bandwidth allocation support
            - ethtool configuration and statistics support
        - IO ranges have been collapsed into just 2 (the SerDes
          driver uses the area inbetween) and the driver uses an
          offset table to get the target instances.
        - register macros have been converted to functions
        - register_netdev() moved to the end of the switch initialization.
        - sparx5_update_port_stats: use reverse christmas tree
        - sparx5_get_sset_strings: copy individual strings
        - sparx5_port_open: updated to better use phylink: just call
          phylink_of_phy_connect directly
        - sparx5_destroy_netdev: always take the NL lock
        - sparx5_attr_stp_state_set: added learning state.
        - sparx5_phylink_mac_config: use phylink to provide the
          status for the devices phylink controls.
        - sparx5_get_1000basex_status: renamed to sparx5_get_dev2g5_status
          and corrected an error when combining the sync and link status
          information.
        - let phylink provide link status for cuPHYs and SFPs
        - corrected the pause mode status handling
        - use ethtool's get_link function directly
        - remove the use of the phy_validate function
        - sparx5_update_counter function: no longer inline
        - Removed the wrapper functions around the mactable mutex
