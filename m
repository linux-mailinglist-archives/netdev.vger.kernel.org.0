I just realized that might not work - Ã­nit_pcmcia() enables the PCMCIA 
interface for us, so the early 8390 reset may not go through at all... 
The module parameter may have to stay as a fallback option at least.

No idea. I've never even seen an 8 bit PCMCIA card - I have a few old 
16/32 bit ones around that were great for crashing my PowerBook, nothing 
else...

Yes, we can at least get rid of the APNE100MBIT option that way. I'll 
have to think about the autoprobe a bit more.

Cheers,
