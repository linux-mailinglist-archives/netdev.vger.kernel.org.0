I see your point. It makes some sense to me. So, the policy should be 
set if MPOL_MF_MOVE* is specified even though no page is migrated so 
that we have consistent behavior for different cases:
* vma is not migratable
* vma is migratable, but pages are unmovable
* vma is migratable, pages are movable, but migrate_pages() fails
