ECDHE+PSK, sadly; the PSK-only method will be deprecated eventually.
But I've got code for that already, so that's nothing to worry about.

Yep, that's the plan. Or, one could say, the 'P' in PSK :-)
That's where keyrings come in; idea is that external agent populate the 
keyring, and the kernel code just looks up keys from there.

Reconnect. We don't have a good way of allowing for re-keying, as the
key material directly relates to information retrieved from the protocol 
itself (here: the TLS key might derived from the DH-CHAP authentication 
protocol running in NVMe space).
So for any re-key operationn we'll should to re-run that protocol. At 
which point we might as well kill the connection and start over, as this 
is basically the same operation.

I'd be happy to have the userspace code; my plan is to work on a frame 
forwarder (such that the TLS handshake and alert frames are forwarded to 
userspace via netlink).
Then I can repurpose the daemon code from the accept solution to handle 
those netlink frames, and use your library for the tls handshake.

That would give us a nice proof of concept, and if designed properly the 
frame forwarder could later be modified to redirect to the in-kernel code.

So having the userspace code already is a bonus.
And the 'patch' really was just for the userspace library :-)

Cheers,

Hannes
