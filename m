Sorry for jumping in late here... one thing that is not clear to me is that if
we are fully sure that skb is dropped by stack anyway due to invalid MTU (redirect
to ingress does this via dev_forward_skb(), it's not fully clear to me whether it's
also the case for the dev_queue_xmiy()), then why not dropping all the MTU checks
aside from SKB_MAX_ALLOC sanity check for BPF helpers and have something like a
device object (similar to e.g. TCP sockets) exposed to BPF prog where we can retrieve
the object and read dev->mtu from the prog, so the BPF program could then do the
"exception" handling internally w/o extra prog needed (we also already expose whether
skb is GSO or not).

Thanks,
Daniel
