Yes, net namespace is changed based on the devlink instance, not
devlink port instance, *right now*.

flavour of the devlink port instance is FLAVOUR_PHYSICAL or
FLAVOUR_VIRTUAL.

The reason I suggest to change the net namespace on devlink port
instance instead of devlink instance isï¼š
I proposed that all the PF and VF in the same ASIC are registered to
the same devlink instance as flavour FLAVOUR_PHYSICAL or FLAVOUR_VIRTUAL
when there are in the same host and in the same net namespace.

If a VF's devlink port instance is unregistered from old devlink
instance in the old net namespace and registered to new devlink
instance in the new net namespace(create a new devlink instance if
needed) when devlink port instance's net namespace is changed, then
the security mentioned by jakub is not a issue any more?
