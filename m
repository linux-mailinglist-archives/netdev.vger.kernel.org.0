Hello My Beloved One, i need your assistance,

Please bear with me. I am writing this letter to you with tears and
sorrow from my heart.

I am Aisha Muammar Gaddafi, the only daughter of the embattled
president of Libya, Hon. Muammar Gaddafi. I know my mail might come to
you as a surprise because you don=E2=80=99t know me, but due to the
unsolicited nature of my situation here in Refugee camp Ouagadougou
Burkina Faso i decided to contact you for help. I have passed through
pains and sorrowful moments since the death of my father. At the same
time, my family is the target of Western nations led by Nato who want
to destroy my father at all costs. Our investments and bank accounts
in several countries are their targets to freeze.

My Father of blessed memory deposited the sum of $27.5M (Twenty Seven
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in a Bank at Burkina Faso which
he used my name as the next of kin. I have been commissioned by the
(BOA) bank to present an interested foreign investor/partner who can
stand as my trustee and receive the fund in his account for a possible
investment in his country due to my refugee status here in Burkina
Faso.

I am in search of an honest and reliable person who will help me and
stand as my trustee so that I will present him to the Bank for the
transfer of the fund to his bank account overseas. I have chosen to
contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray my
trust but rather take me as your own sister or daughter. If this
transaction interests you, you don't have to disclose it to anybody
because of what is going on with my entire family, if the United
nation happens to know this account, they will freeze it as they
freeze others, so please keep this transaction only to yourself until
we finalize it.

Sorry for my pictures. I will enclose it in my next mail and more
about me when I hear from you okay.

Yours Sincerely
Best Regard,
Aisha Gaddafi
