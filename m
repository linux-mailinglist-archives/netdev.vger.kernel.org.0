Yes, I'm still checking bugzilla.kernel.org for sound bug reports.
Not always promptly reacting like the distro bugzilla, but it's
regularly scanned and covered in the best effort basis.

Graphics people already moved out of bugzilla to gitlab Issues in
their own gitlab.freedesktop.org.  Not sure about others.

Maybe we can ask Konstantin about that at least for wireless

Yeah, it's not only about wireless but true in general: handling bug
reports is a tough task and often annoying.  Moreover, everyone of
course wants to believe that their driver is bug free :)
