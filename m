I am not sure I understand the exact usage of controller and why controller
id is in "devlink_port_*_attrs".

Let's consider a simplified case where there is two PF(supposing both have
VF enabled), and each PF has different controller and each PF corresponds
to a different physical port(Or it is about multi-host case multi PF may
sharing the same physical port?):
1. I suppose each PF has it's devlink instance for mlx case(I suppose each
   VF can not have it's own devlink instance for VF shares the same physical
   port with PF, right?).
2. each PF's devlink instance has three types of port, which is
   FLAVOUR_PHYSICAL, FLAVOUR_PCI_PF and FLAVOUR_PCI_VF(supposing I understand
   port flavour correctly).

If I understand above correctly, all ports in the same devlink instance should
have the same controller id, right? If yes, why not put the controller id in
the devlink instance?

Yes, that is what I try to do: shared status/parameters in devlink instance,
physical port specific status/parameters in devlink port instance.

I do not think each function need a devlink instance if there is a
devlink instance representing a whole ASIC, using the devlink port
instance to represent the function seems enough?
