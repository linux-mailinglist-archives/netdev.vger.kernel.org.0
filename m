[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggestions
to make it better, or if you want it re-generated with the latest status.]

Of the currently open syzbot reports against the upstream kernel, I've manually
marked 36 of them as possibly being bugs in the "net/bpf" subsystem.  I've
listed these reports below, sorted by an algorithm that tries to list first the
reports most likely to be still valid, important, and actionable.

Of these 36 bugs, 8 were seen in mainline in the last week.

Of these 36 bugs, 12 were bisected to commits from the following people:

	John Fastabend <john.fastabend@gmail.com>
	Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>
	Alexei Starovoitov <ast@fb.com>

If you believe a bug is no longer valid, please close the syzbot report by
sending a '#syz fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the
original thread, as explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug to the "net/bpf" subsystem, please let me
know, and if possible forward the report to the correct people or mailing list.

Here are the bugs:
