This is what i added in documentation on v13


Device file node is created with format:-

/dev/mhi_<mhi_device_name>

mhi_device_name includes mhi controller name and the name of the MHI
channel being used by MHI client in userspace to send or receive data
using MHI protocol.

â€‹
Loic's patch is going to update the controller name as indexed 
controller name, which goes fine with or without his change going first.

For example:   With Loic's change name of device node would be 
/dev/mhi_mhi0_QMI

Without Loic's change it would be

/dev/mhi_0000:00:01.2_QMI

Please let me know if i am missing something.

Thanks,
Hemant
