I'm sorry but I don't follow you here, what do you mean by "the table
gets too large"?

Before this series: many drivers would not set the symbol duration
properly. In this case the scan will likely not work because wait
periods will be too short. But that's how it is, we miss some
information.

But for hwsim, I've handled a lot of situations so yes, there are
still channels that won't have a proper symbol duration because I just
don't know them, but for most of them (several pages) it will work like
a charm.

We already have all this handled, no need for extra software. You can
test active and passive scans between two hwsim devices already:

# iwpan dev wpan0 beacons send interval 15
# iwpan dev wpan1 scan type active duration 1
# iwpan dev wpan0 beacons stop

or

# iwpan dev wpan0 beacons send interval 1
# iwpan dev wpan1 scan type passive duration 2
# iwpan dev wpan0 beacons stop

I hope the above will match your expectations.
