Hi Wenjia,

Thanks for your reply.

What do you mean by those patches? My plan is to delete the first patch in this series,
that is, 'remove locks smc_client_lgr_pending and smc_server_lgr_pending', while other patches
should be retained.

They has almost nothing impact on SMC-D or simple enough to be tested. If you agree with this,
I can then issue the next version as soon as possible to remove the first patch, and I think
we can quickly promote those patches.

Thanks.
Wenjia
