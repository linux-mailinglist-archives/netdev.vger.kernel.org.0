will update it to use 2500BaseX in the next patch, thanks for this comment.

thanks for the comment, will update the patch to merge it into at803x code.

Hi Andrew, thanks for this comment, qca8081 is mainly used in the IPQ 
SOC chip currently.

qca801 is configured as MASTER_SLAVE_CFG_SLAVE_PREFERRED by default.

the SEED random lower value is for making the qca8081 linked as SLAVE 
mode when the link

partner is also configured as MASTER_SLAVE_CFG_SLAVE_PREFERRED in 
auto-negotiation.
