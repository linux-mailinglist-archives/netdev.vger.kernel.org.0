We're currently not doing any routing things in BPF yet. All the routing
manipulation has been done in iptables / netfilter so far. I'm not super
familiar with routing stuff but from what I understand there is some
relatively complicated stuff going on with BGP and ipsec tunnels at the
moment. Not sure if that answers your question.

I had not considered that yet. Are you suggesting adding a new
passthrough netdev thing that'll defrags? I looked at the macvlan driver
and it looks like it defrags to handle some multicast corner case.

Does that work for forwarding cases? I'm reading through [0] and it
seems to suggest that it'll only defrag for locally destined packets:

    If the destination IP address is matches with
    local NIC's IP address, the dst_input() function will brings the packets
    into the ip_local_deliver(), which will defrag the packet and pass it
    to the NF_IP_LOCAL_IN hook

Faking local delivery seems kinda ugly -- maybe I don't know any clean
ways.
