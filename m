Right, sorry if the context wasn't clear, I only realized part of the message was removed in the 
first reply after sending. The question from Miroslav was, basically, "would kernel accept something 
to only get notified of extts pulses on a given channel, and, if so, how would we go about doing that".

The "we get pulses from all extts channels on the same socket" thing is a bit annoying to munge into 
chrony - it has the concept of "refclocks" which are a single clock, in this case a single pps pulse 
generator. If you have two of them on the same PTP clock but coming in on different pins/channels it 
doesn't have a way to express that outside of two refclocks. While we could take pulses from both 
refclocks on one socket and shove them into some queue and have the refclocks pick that data up its 
a bunch of complexity on the client side and not super clean in the current codebase.

Thanks,
Matt
