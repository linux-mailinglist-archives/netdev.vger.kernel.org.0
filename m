I tried the above config, unfortunately I was still not able to trigger
the problem.

Are you true the above 1~3 step is happening for the same page?
If it is the same page, there must be something wrong here.

Normally there are 1024 BD for a rx ring:

BD_0 BD_1 BD_2 BD_3 BD_4 .... BD_1020 BD_1021  BD_1022  BD_1023
           ^         ^
         head       tail

Suppose head is manipulated by driver, and tail is manipulated by
hw.

driver allocates buffer for BD pointed by head, as the frag page
recycling is introduced in this patch, the BD_0 and BD_1's buffer
may point to the same pageï¼ˆ4K page size, and each BD only need
2k Buffer.
hw dma the data to the buffer pointed by tail when packet is received.

so step 1 Normally happen for the BD pointed by head,
and step 2 & 3 Normally happen for the BD pointed by tail.
And Normally there are at least (1024 - RCB_NOF_ALLOC_RX_BUFF_ONCE) BD
between head and tail, so it is unlikely that head and tail's BD buffer
points to the same page.
