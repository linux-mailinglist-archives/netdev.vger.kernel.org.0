I agree, the current commit message is misleading.

MAC implementation[1] in a lot of NXP SoCs comes with in-band aneg enabled
by default, and it does expect Clause 37 auto-negotiation to complete
between MAC and PHY before the actual data transfer happens.

[1] https://community.nxp.com/pwmxy87654/attachments/pwmxy87654/t-series/3241/1/AN3869(1).pdf

I faced such issue while integrating VSC85xx PHY
with one of the recent NXP SoC having similar MAC implementation.
Not sure if this is a problem on MAC side or PHY side,
But having Clause 37 support should help in most cases I believe.
