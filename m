Dearest beloved in the Lord,

I am Ms. Agnes George,  a 75 year old British woman. I was born an
orphan and GOD blessed me abundantly with riches but no children nor
husband which makes me an unhappy woman. Now I am affected with cancer
of the lung and breast with a partial stroke which has affected my
speech. I can no longer talk well and half of my body is paralyzed, I
sent this email to you with the help of my private female nurse.

My condition is really deteriorating day by day and it is really
giving me lots to think about.  This has prompted my decision to
donate all I have for charity; I have made numerous donations all over
the world. After going through your profile, I decided to make my last
donation of Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United Kingdom Pounds
(UK=C2=A310.500, 000, 00) to you as my investment manager. I want you to
build an Orphanage home with my name ( Agnes George  ) in your
country.

If you are willing and able to do this task for the sake of humanity
then send me below information for more details to receive the funds.

1. Name...................................................

2. Phone number...............................

3. Address.............................................

4. Country of Origin and residence

Ms. Agnes George.
