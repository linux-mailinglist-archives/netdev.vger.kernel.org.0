+The second case is when you share a UMEM between sockets that are

+create one FILL ring and one COMPLETION ring for each unique
+netdev,queue_id pair. Let us say you want to create two sockets bound
+to two different queue ids on the same netdev. Create the first socket
+and bind it in the normal way. Create a second socket and create an RX
+and a TX ring, or at least one of them, and then one FILL and

+XDP_SHARED_UMEM option and provide the initial socket's fd in the
+sxdp_shared_umem_fd field as you registered the UMEM on that
+socket. These two sockets will now share one and the same UMEM.
+
+There is no need to supply an XDP program like the one in the previous
+case where sockets were bound to the same queue id and
+device. Instead, use the NIC's packet steering capabilities to steer
+the packets to the right queue. In the previous example, there is only
+one queue shared among sockets, so the NIC cannot do this steering. It
+can only steer between queues.
+
+In libbpf, you need to use the xsk_socket__create_shared() API as it
+takes a reference to a FILL ring and a COMPLETION ring that will be
+created for you and bound to the shared UMEM. You can use this
+function for all the sockets you create, or you can use it for the
+second and following ones and use xsk_socket__create() for the first
+one. Both methods yield the same result.

+Note that a UMEM can be shared between sockets on the same queue id
+and device, as well as between queues on the same device and between
+devices at the same time.
