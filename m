From: Sven Eckelmann <sven@narfation.org>

The commit 8c46fcd78308 ("batman-adv: disable ethtool link speed detection
when auto negotiation off") disabled the usage of ethtool's link_ksetting
when auto negotation was enabled due to invalid values when used with
tun/tap virtual net_devices. According to the patch, automatic measurements
should be used for these kind of interfaces.

But there are major flaws with this argumentation:

* automatic measurements are not implemented
* auto negotiation has nothing to do with the validity of the retrieved
  values

The first point has to be fixed by a longer patch series. The "validity"
part of the second point must be addressed in the same patch series by
dropping the usage of ethtool's link_ksetting (thus always doing automatic
measurements over ethernet).

Drop the patch again to have more default values for various net_device
types/configurations. The user can still overwrite them using the
batadv_hardif's BATADV_ATTR_THROUGHPUT_OVERRIDE.
