Hmm... you are saying that we are allowed to break other in-kernel 
subsystem by some change? Sounds strange...

I understand the advantage, but I can't trust such a third-party kernel 
emulation solution for this kind of thing which handles critical data path.

I don't want to mess up the core flow infrastructure either. I'm all 
ears about less invasive ways. Using indirect callback sounds like a 
good idea. Will give it a try. Many thanks.
