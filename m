This is the result of "fuzzing around" on qemu. :)

I was more confused with the comment you added to that code:

   /* some devices set dwNtbOutMaxSize too low for the above default */
   min = min(min, max);

... which looks as though it should solve the issue of an inadequate
dwNtbOutMaxSize, but it almost does the opposite.  I initially
changed this segment to use the max() macro instead, but the
subsequent clamp_t() macro simply chooses 'max' (0) value over the now
sane 'min' one.

Which is why I chose

I'm not an expert on the SKB code, but in my simple view of the world,
if you wish to use a buffer for any amount of data, you should
allocate space for it.

I tried this.  It didn't work either.

See the subsequent clamp_t() call a few lines down.

So the data that is added to the SKB is ctx->max_ndp_size, which is
allocated in cdc_ncm_init().  The code that does it looks like:

   if (ctx->is_ndp16)                                                                                         
        ctx->max_ndp_size = sizeof(struct usb_cdc_ncm_ndp16) +
	                    (ctx->tx_max_datagrams + 1) *
			    sizeof(struct usb_cdc_ncm_dpe16);                                                                                               
    else                                                                                                       
        ctx->max_ndp_size = sizeof(struct usb_cdc_ncm_ndp32) +
	                    (ctx->tx_max_datagrams + 1) *
			    sizeof(struct usb_cdc_ncm_dpe32);  

So this should be the size of the allocation too, right?

Why would the platform ever need to over-ride this?  The platform
can't make the data area smaller since there won't be enough room.  It
could perhaps make it bigger, but the min_t() and clamp_t() macros
will end up choosing the above allocation anyway.

This leaves me feeling a little perplexed.

If there isn't a good reason for over-riding then I could simplify
cdc_ncm_check_tx_max() greatly.

What do *you* think? :)
