Multicolor LED framework is especially useful for the arrangements
where we want to have a possibility of controlling mixed LED color
in a wide range.
In the discussed case it seems that having two separate LED class
devices will be sufficient. Unless the LEDs have 255 or so possible
brightness levels each and they can produce meaningful mixed color
per some device state.

What do you mean by dependency here? You can write LED multicolor class
driver that will aggregate whatever LEDs you want, provided that it will
know how to control them. However, the target use case was RGB LED
controllers.
