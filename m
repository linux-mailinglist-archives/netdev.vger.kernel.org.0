Hi everyone,

It's seems the RFC patch been hanging for some time.Â  I would like to 
politely inquire if there are any suggestions or criticisms.
Compared to previous patches, this patch has several main features:

1. Allow registration of multiple negotiators, each SMC negotiator has a 
name and can be indexed that name
2. no read/write lock anymore
3. support bpf update

If you have any suggestions or criticisms, please let me know.

Thanks
D. Wythe
