Automation, not sure. It would probably just see type of gearbox and
flash it. Not sure I understand the question, perhaps you could explain?
Plus, the possibility is to auto-flash the GB from driver directly.


>You're not designing an interface for SDK users but for end users.

Sure, that is the aim of this API. Human end user. That is why I wanted
the user to see the relationships between devlink dev, line cards and
the gearboxes on them. If you want to limit the visibility, sure, just
tell me how.

Okay, that is not only to expose devices. That is also to expose info
about linecards, like HW revision, INI version etc. Where else to put
it? I can perhaps embed it into devlink dev info, but I thought separate
command would be more suitable. object cmd, object info cmd. It is
more clear I believe.

That is a different device model comparing what we have.
These are like "nested switches". If they are separate devices with
everything, they can be modeled as separate devlink device instances.
No problem. Different case though.

Yep.

Tell me where to cut it so it still makes sense.

That is why I'm asking :)

Would be rather:

          lc2.gearbox0 1.1.3
          lc2.gearbox1 1.2.4
          lc8.gearbox0 1.2.3

Okay, I see. So instead of having clear api with relationships and
clear human+machine readability we have squahed indexes into strings.
I fail to see the benefit, other than no-api-extension :/ On contrary.

Quite odd. I find it questionable to say at least to mix multiple
command netlink outputs into one output. The processing of it would
be a small nightmare considering the way how the netlink message
processing works in iproute2 :/
