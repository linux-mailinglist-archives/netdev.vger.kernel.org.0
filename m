Why is that missing? We're going behind the back of the toolstack to do 
the unbind and bind so why should we expect it to re-execute a hotplug 
script?

This is pretty key. The frontend should not notice an unbind/bind i.e. 
there should be no evidence of it happening by examining states in 
xenstore (from the guest side).
