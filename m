Ah, I see, thanks.

I can imagine that this will see a flurry of activity in the early
phase so I think a 'semi test repo' makes sense.

Provideded license allows this, useable bits and pieces can then
be grafted on to libnftnl (or iptables or whatever).

Not sure what 'non raw hook' is.  Idea was to expose

1. protcocol family
2. hook number (prerouting, input etc)
3. priority

to userspace via bpf syscall/bpf link.

userspace would then provide the above info to kernel via
bpf(... BPF_LINK_CREATE )

which would then end up doing:
--------------
h.hook = nf_hook_run_bpf; // wrapper to call BPF_PROG_RUN
h.priv = prog; // the bpf program to run
h.pf = attr->netfilter.pf;
h.priority = attr->netfilter.priority;
h.hooknum = attr->netfilter.hooknum;

nf_register_net_hook(net, &h);
--------------

After that nf_hook_slow() calls the bpf program just like any
other of the netfilter hooks.

Does that make sense or did you have something else in mind?
