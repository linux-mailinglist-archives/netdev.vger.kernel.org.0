Hi,

This applies cleanly to linux-next and mmotm, and also to linux.git if
linux-next's commit 20cac10710c9 ("mm/gup_benchmark: fix MAP_HUGETLB
case") is first applied there.

This provides tracking of dma-pinned pages. This is a prerequisite to
solving the larger problem of proper interactions between file-backed
pages, and [R]DMA activities, as discussed in [1], [2], [3], and in
a remarkable number of email threads since about 2017. :)

A new internal gup flag, FOLL_PIN is introduced, and thoroughly
documented in the last patch's Documentation/vm/pin_user_pages.rst.

I believe that this will provide a good starting point for doing the
layout lease work that Ira Weiny has been working on. That's because
these new wrapper functions provide a clean, constrained, systematically
named set of functionality that, again, is required in order to even
know if a page is "dma-pinned".

In contrast to earlier approaches, the page tracking can be
incrementally applied to the kernel call sites that, until now, have
been simply calling get_user_pages() ("gup"). In other words, opt-in by
changing from this:

    get_user_pages() (sets FOLL_GET)
    put_page()

to this:
    pin_user_pages() (sets FOLL_PIN)
    put_user_page()

Because there are interdependencies with FOLL_LONGTERM, a similar
conversion as for FOLL_PIN, was applied. The change was from this:

    get_user_pages(FOLL_LONGTERM) (also sets FOLL_GET)
    put_page()

to this:
    pin_longterm_pages() (sets FOLL_PIN | FOLL_LONGTERM)
    put_user_page()

Patch summary:

* Patches 1-4: refactoring and preparatory cleanup, independent fixes
    (Patch 4: V4L2-core bug fix (can be separately applied))

* Patch 5: introduce pin_user_pages(), FOLL_PIN, but no functional
           changes yet
* Patches 6-11: Convert existing put_user_page() callers, to use the
                new pin*()
* Patch 12: Activate tracking of FOLL_PIN pages.
* Patches 13-15: convert FOLL_LONGTERM callers
* Patches: 16-17: gup_benchmark and run_vmtests support
* Patch 18: enforce FOLL_LONGTERM as a gup-internal (only) flag
* Patch 19: Documentation/vm/pin_user_pages.rst

Testing:

* I've done some overall kernel testing (LTP, and a few other goodies),
  and some directed testing to exercise some of the changes. And as you
  can see, gup_benchmark is enhanced to exercise this. Basically, I've been
  able to runtime test the core get_user_pages() and pin_user_pages() and
  related routines, but not so much on several of the call sites--but those
  are generally just a couple of lines changed, each.

  Not much of the kernel is actually using this, which on one hand
  reduces risk quite a lot. But on the other hand, testing coverage
  is low. So I'd love it if, in particular, the Infiniband and PowerPC
  folks could do a smoke test of this series for me.

  Also, my runtime testing for the call sites so far is very weak:

    * io_uring: Some directed tests from liburing exercise this, and they p=
ass.
    * process_vm_access.c: A small directed test passes.
    * gup_benchmark: the enhanced version hits the new gup.c code, and pass=
es.
    * infiniband (still only have crude "IB pingpong" working, on a
                  good day: it's not exercising my conversions at runtime..=
.)
    * VFIO: compiles (I'm vowing to set up a run time test soon, but it's
                      not ready just yet)
    * powerpc: it compiles...
    * drm/via: compiles...
    * goldfish: compiles...
    * net/xdp: compiles...
    * media/v4l2: compiles...

Next:

* Get the block/bio_vec sites converted to use pin_user_pages().

* Work with Ira and Dave Chinner to weave this together with the
  layout lease stuff.
