[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggestions
to make it better, or if you want it re-generated with the latest status.]

Of the currently open syzbot reports against the upstream kernel, I've manually
marked 2 of them as possibly being bugs in the "net/rxrpc" subsystem.  I've
listed these bug reports below.

If you believe a bug is no longer valid, please close it by sending a '#syz
fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the original thread, as
explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug to the "net/rxrpc" subsystem, please let me
know and (if possible) forward it to the correct place.

Here are the bug reports:
