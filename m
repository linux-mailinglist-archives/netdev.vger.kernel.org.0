Hm, but looking at perf RB handling code, it can deal with nesting situation
just fine. I think this was your main concern with prior email:

  because I suspect that 'struct bpf_event_entry' is not reentrable
  (even w/o issues with 'struct perf_sample_data').

  Even if we always use 'struct perf_sample_data' on stack, I suspect
  the same 'struct bpf_event_entry' cannot be reused in the nested way.

Check the perf_output_{get,put}_handle() and the way it updates head pointer
and does the final propagation to user_page. So if it's designed to handle
these situations, then bailing out doesn't make sense from BPF side.
