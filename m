	The line in question is:
	
#ifdef CONFIG_LOCKDEP
	WARN_ON(lockdep_is_held(&bond->mode_lock));
#endif

	The WARN_ON is triggering if mode_lock is held, not asserting
that mode_lock is held.  I think that's wrong anyway, since mode_lock
could be held by some other thread, leading to false positives, thus the
change to might_sleep.
