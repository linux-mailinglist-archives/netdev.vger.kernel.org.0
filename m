I've just sent a cleanup series. It won't make the conversion easier to digest,
though.

I can, of course, effectively revert 6ce29b0e2a04 ("gianfar: Avoid unnecessary
reg accesses in adjust_link()") and 2a4eebf0c485 ("gianfar: Restore link state
settings after MAC reset") just before the conversion, but I fail to see a point
in that. It would only make subsequent bisection harder.

OK. I believe this comment only applies to a PHYLINK-based driver and I should
omit this change from a cleanup series? Because in the PHYLIB-based driver this
code only gets executed when the link is up, and I can't immediately see how it
could be called with phydev->speed set to SPEED_UNKNOWN.
