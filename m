I don't understand what you are saying. You reported a problem with
IPV6 checksums generation. The HW doesn't support it. What's "not a
matter of unsupported csum" ?

Your patch uses a *deprecated* bit to tell the network stack to only do
HW checksum generation on IPV4.

This bit is deprecated for a reason, again, see skbuff.h. The right
approach, *which the driver already does*, is to tell the stack that we
support HW checksuming using NETIF_F_HW_CSUM, and then, in the transmit
handler, to call skb_checksum_help() to have the SW calculate the
checksum if it's not a supported type.

This is exactly what ftgmac100_prep_tx_csum() does. It only enables HW
checksum generation on supported types and uses skb_checksum_help()
otherwise, supported types being protocol ETH_P_IP and IP protocol
being raw IP, TCP and UDP.

So this *should* have fallen back to SW for IPV6. So either something
in my code there is making an incorrect assumption, or something is
broken in skb_checksum_help() for IPV6 (which I somewhat doubt) or
something else I can't think of, but setting a *deprecated* flag is
definitely not the right answer, neither is completely disabling HW
checksumming.

So can you investigate what's going on a bit more closely please ? I
can try myself, though I have very little experience with IPV6 and
probably won't have time before next week.

Cheers,
Ben.
