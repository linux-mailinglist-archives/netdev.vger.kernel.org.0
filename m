Yeah no problem, I also know what it is like to be on the reviewer
side, and while I like to have the full contribution to get the big
picture, I also find it much easier to review smaller series, so let's
got for it now that the main boundaries for the scan support have been
shared.

Yup! I'll soon send a v3 addressing your comments, this time I'll even
split the first series so that you have a series with only fixes for
the wpan branch, and another series with very small cleanups for
wpan-next. I'll send both because they are not very big.

Thanks,
