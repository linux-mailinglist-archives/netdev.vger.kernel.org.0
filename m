Hi,

This implements an API naming change (put_user_page*() -->
unpin_user_page*()), and also implements tracking of FOLL_PIN pages. It
extends that tracking to a few select subsystems. More subsystems will
be added in follow up work.

Christoph Hellwig, a couple of points of interest:

a) I've moved the bulk of the code out of the inline functions, as
   requested, for the devmap changes (patch 4: "mm: devmap: refactor
   1-based refcounting for ZONE_DEVICE pages").

b) Contrary to my earlier response to your review, I have not actually
   merged patch 23 ("mm/gup: pass flags arg to __gup_device_*
   functions") into patch 24 ("mm/gup: track FOLL_PIN pages"). This is
   because I suspect that it's better to avoid making patch 24 any larger
   and worse to review than it already is. But if you feel strongly
   about it, I'll combine them anyway.

Changes since v7:

* Rebased onto Linux 5.5-rc1

* Reworked the grab_page() and try_grab_compound_head(), for API
  consistency and less diffs (thanks to Jan Kara's reviews).

* Added Leon Romanovsky's reviewed-by tags for two of the IB-related
  patches.

* patch 4 refactoring changes, as mentioned above.

There is a git repo and branch, for convenience:

    git@github.com:johnhubbard/linux.git pin_user_pages_tracking_v8

For the remaining list of "changes since version N", those are all in
v7, which is here:

Overview:

This is a prerequisite to solving the problem of proper interactions
between file-backed pages, and [R]DMA activities, as discussed in [1],
[2], [3], and in a remarkable number of email threads since about
2017. :)

A new internal gup flag, FOLL_PIN is introduced, and thoroughly
documented in the last patch's Documentation/vm/pin_user_pages.rst.

I believe that this will provide a good starting point for doing the
layout lease work that Ira Weiny has been working on. That's because
these new wrapper functions provide a clean, constrained, systematically
named set of functionality that, again, is required in order to even
know if a page is "dma-pinned".

In contrast to earlier approaches, the page tracking can be
incrementally applied to the kernel call sites that, until now, have
been simply calling get_user_pages() ("gup"). In other words, opt-in by
changing from this:

    get_user_pages() (sets FOLL_GET)
    put_page()

to this:
    pin_user_pages() (sets FOLL_PIN)
    unpin_user_page()

Testing:

* I've done some overall kernel testing (LTP, and a few other goodies),
  and some directed testing to exercise some of the changes. And as you
  can see, gup_benchmark is enhanced to exercise this. Basically, I've
  been able to runtime test the core get_user_pages() and
  pin_user_pages() and related routines, but not so much on several of
  the call sites--but those are generally just a couple of lines
  changed, each.

  Not much of the kernel is actually using this, which on one hand
  reduces risk quite a lot. But on the other hand, testing coverage
  is low. So I'd love it if, in particular, the Infiniband and PowerPC
  folks could do a smoke test of this series for me.

  Runtime testing for the call sites so far is pretty light:

    * io_uring: Some directed tests from liburing exercise this, and
                they pass.
    * process_vm_access.c: A small directed test passes.
    * gup_benchmark: the enhanced version hits the new gup.c code, and
                     passes.
    * infiniband: ran "ib_write_bw", which exercises the umem.c changes,
                  but not the other changes.
    * VFIO: compiles (I'm vowing to set up a run time test soon, but it's
                      not ready just yet)
    * powerpc: it compiles...
    * drm/via: compiles...
    * goldfish: compiles...
    * net/xdp: compiles...
    * media/v4l2: compiles...
