That's great, thanks!

It looks like PCI rtlwifi hardware uses a tasklet (specifically,
_rtl_pci_prepare_bcn_tasklet() in pci.c) to periodically transfer the
current beacon to the NIC.

This tasklet is scheduled on a RTL_IMR_BCNINT interrupt, which sounds
like a beacon interval interrupt.

The beacon seems to be updating now and STAs no longer get stuck in PS
mode.
Although sometimes (every 2-3 minutes with continuous 1s interval pings)
there is around 5s delay in updating the transmitted beacon - don't know
why, maybe the NIC hardware still has the old version in queue?

I doubt, however that this set_tim() callback should be added for every
rtlwifi device type.

As I have said above, PCI devices seem to already have a mechanism in
place to update their beacon each beacon interval.
Your test that RTL8821AE works without this patch confirms that (at
least for the rtl8821ae driver).

It seems this callback is only necessarily for USB rtlwifi devices.
Which currently means rtl8192cu only.

Thanks,
Maciej
