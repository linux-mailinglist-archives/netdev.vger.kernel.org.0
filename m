Hi Krzysztof,

Thanks for responding.

Most devices _support_ autobaud mode but I don't have a definitive list. 
The CYW5557x is the first device family to _require_ autobaud mode for 
FW loading as far as I know.

Sorry, will change in next rev.

Correct, the host triggers using autobaud.

I've been thinking of it as a a property of a specific board HW, 
inherited either from a property of the device being used or from a 
property of the HW design (e.g. a PCB using an alternate crystal 
frequency yielding a non-standard baud rate).

Yes, the commit message describes two separate reasons why autobaud mode 
would be required:

1. Requirement coming from Device: "Some devices (e.g. CYW5557x) require 
autobaud mode to enable FW loading."

2. Requirement coming from HW design: "Autobaud mode can also be 
required on some boards where the controller device is using a 
non-standard baud rate when first powered on."

Sorry about that. I've really been struggling with what should go into 
the description. Any suggestions or hints would be much appreciated.

How about, changing the property name to "brcm,requires-autobaud-mode" 
and the description to:
"Set this property if autobaud mode is required. Autobaud mode is 
required if the device's baud rate in normal mode is not supported by 
the host or if the device requires autobaud mode startup before loading FW."

Would that be an appropriate name and description?

Ok, will remove in next rev.
