Hi Petr

All current drivers which don't look in NVMEM don't expect
EPROBE_DEFER. So not returning it as the result of the probe is fine.
The one driver which does expect EPROBE_DEFER already has the code to
handle it.

What you have to be careful of, is the return value from your new code
looking in NVMEM. It should only return EPROBE_DEFER, or another error
if there really is expected to be a value in NVMEM, or getting it from
NVMEM resulted in an error.

I've not looked at the details of nvmem_get_mac_address(), but it
should be a two stage process. The first is to look in device tree to
find the properties. Device tree is always accessible. So performing a
lookup will never return EPROBE_DEFER. If there are no properties, it
probably return -ENODEV. You need to consider that as not being a real
error, since these are optional properties. of_get_mac_address() needs
to try the next source of the MAC address. The second stage is to look
into the NVMEM. That could return -EPROBE_DEFER and you should return
that error, or any other error at this stage. The MAC address should
exist in NVMEM so we want to know about the error.
