nope, I've read your email, that's the only reason I've sent out this v2 which
added Fixes: tag you've suggested in your email.

this patch series is against net-next, and I've added Fixes: tag as you've
requested in this v2 series[1] (which expands to commit[2] in net-next):

 Fixes: d01f449c008a ("of_net: add NVMEM support to of_get_mac_address")

it was applied[2] to David's net-next tree, but unfortunately partialy, just 9
patches out of 10, as the patch 05/10 in that series (which is patch 1/4 in
this series) never reached netdev mailing list and patchwork, probably because
of some netdev mailing list software and/or patchwork hiccup, very likely due
to the long list of recipients in that patch and as I'm not subscribed to the
netdev (due to the high traffic) I'm probably treaten somehow differently.

So to sum it up, I've simply thought, that it was enough to send out v2 with
that Fixes: tag and considered it done.

> I only see comments from last Friday that it shouldn't be applied...

I'm sorry, but which comments do you mean exactly? Those about the
`nvmem-mac-address` DT (sysfs) entry? If that is the case, from my point of
view, I've provided reasonable arguments and nobody told me, that I'm wrong
with my reasoning or NACKed this explicitly, so David probably considered my
arguments good enough and merged it as it is? I don't have any other
explanation.

Yes, and I agree with you, but I've simply thought, that if any of the
maintainers who previously reviewed the series didn't objected about this,
that they're possibly going to squash those patches by themselves during the
merging process or that they're going to tell me to do so and I would address
this in the latest interation of the patchset before merge.

Anyway, is there any possibility how to fix that now?

I'm just occasional contributor, so I'm sorry, but I can hardly provide any
input.
