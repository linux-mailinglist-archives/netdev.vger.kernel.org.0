I've added a few more parameters to be able to reflect the type of
device (ffd, rfd, rfd_r/tx) and also eventually its coordinator state.
I've hacked into nl802154 to give these information to the user and let
it device wether the device (if it's an ffd) should act as a
coordinator. This is only a first step before we create a real PAN
creation procedure of course.

I've then adapted the following patches to follow check against the
device/coordinator state to decide if an operation should be aborted or
not.
