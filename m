Awesome! I think now it is clearer. To be in sync with devlink dev
flash cmd option, we have to have "lc 1" here, have to think how that
can be done.

Well, you are basically leading my arm when I'm drawing the thing. Looks
like you exactly know what you are looking for. That is why.
If you let me to the stuff my way, we would be already done.
You have to decide which way you want this.

And again, for the record, I strongly believe that a separate dl
instance for this does not make any sense at all :/ I wonder why you
still think it does.
