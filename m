I confirm that, indeed, it was unintended. While my patch was getting
reviewed, it was reported by someone that 0ce779a9f501 introduced the
following logic, which I removed in my patch:

-               if (addr->sin_addr.s_addr == htonl(INADDR_ANY))
-                       chk_addr_ret = RTN_LOCAL;
-               else
-                       chk_addr_ret = inet_addr_type(net,
addr->sin_addr.s_addr);

I proposed a revert of ping.c, but as the reporter did not respond to
the request to clarify, the patch was applied as it was. Needless to
say, the point is now clear. :)

Digging a bit further, it seems that the logic was actually already
implemented in c319b4d76b9, the original ICMP socket implementation.
Nothing about the behaviour of broadcast and multicast bind addresses is
mentioned in the commit message or linked Mac OS X documentation
(although it would be interesting to test how Mac OS X behaves - anyone
with a Mac around here that can do that?)

To recap the pre-5.17 and 5.17+ behaviours, without IP_TRANSPARENT
(and similar flags):
+--------------------------------------------+
| addr                         | pre | 5.17+ |
+------------------------------+-----+-------+
| 0.0.0.0 / any                | OK  | OK    |
| 255.255.255.255 / broadcast  | ERR | OK :( |
| 224.x.x.x / multicast        | ERR | OK :( |
| address present              | OK  | OK    |
| address absent               | ERR | ERR   |
+------------------------------+-----+-------+

I agree, it doesn't make sense to be able to do that. That's probably
why the check was done that way in the first place. I think the previous
behaviour should be restored. Not by reverting (part of) the patch,
because honestly the original code sucked, but by rewriting it properly.
And more importantly I think that test cases for that should be added in
the kernel (this has been in two released minor versions before even
being caught...)

I should be able to roll up a patch inside a few days, if this sounds
like a good approach to everyone.
