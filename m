The issue only appeared for some community members using Surface devices,
happening on the Surface Book 2 of one person, but not on the Surface Book
2 of another person. When investigating we were poking around in the dark
for a long time and almost gave up until we found that those two devices
had different hardware revisions of the same wifi card installed (ChipRev
20 vs 21).

So it seems pretty clear that with revision 21 they fixed some hardware
bug that causes those spurious wakeups.

FWIW, obviously a proper workaround for this would have to be implemented
in the firmware.

Sounds like a good idea, yeah.
