I had a second thought on this. This fix should go mainline too. This is a 
case we are sending out queued packets when arp reply from the neighbour 
comes in. With 5.x kernel, a dst in DST_OBSOLETE_DEAD state leads to dropping
of this packet. It is not as bad as with 4.x kernel that may end up with an
all-zero mac address packet out to ethernet or choking up ath9k when using 
block ack. Dropping the packet is still wrong. Iâ€™ll repost as a fix to
mainline and target backport to 4.x LTS releases.

Best regards
