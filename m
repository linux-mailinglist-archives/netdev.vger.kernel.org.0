The case for the 5272 is that it only has instruction cache, no data cache.
That was the first supported part, and the one I have used the most over
the years (though not so much recently). So it should be ok.

I am not convinced about the other version 2 cores either. They all have
both instruction and data cache - they can be flexibily configured to be
all instruction, or a mix of instruction and data - but the default is
both.

I don't have a 532x platform, so I have never done any work on that.
The flush_cache_all() for that seems dubious to me.

It is. Testing these changes failed at boot without changing this one too.
