Not requiring the device to be reset sounds sensible to me given that
D3hot is what devices are transitioned into during suspend.

But anyway, that doesn't really get us any further except it somewhat
gives an explanation why the LTR is suddenly 0 after the reset. Or are
you making the point that we shouldn't rely on "undefined state" for this
hack because not all PCI bridges/ports will necessarily behave the same?
