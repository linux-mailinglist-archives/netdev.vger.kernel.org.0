After internal discussion, our recommendations as follow:

1. The relevant timeout should be increased from 300ms to 1000ms 
regardless of anything else. We haven't interface with CSME. Despite 
this, we compared it to the Windows driver and decided to recommend an 
increased delay up to 1000ms. 
(https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/intel-wired-lan/patch/20200323191639.48826-1-aaron.ma@canonical.com/ 
- this is expected solve part of the problem)

2.Since S0ix is mainstream now and users expect the related power
consumption savings, the flow should be enabled by default
We don't want any lists for controlling how the feature should be
enabled/disabled.
There should be a controllable flag for enabling/disabling the S0ix 
flow, since this is the flow that introduced the inter-op problems with ME.

3.The flag must be persistent (keeping its value across reboots/Sx 
entries) and controllable at runtime, either by the OEM (during initial 
setup) or by a privileged user (admin).
