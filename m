OK the HW team said that FIFO depth is no longer a mandatory field to be 
written for either RGMII or SGMII.

So my suggestion here is that we deprecate, but support in the driver, 
the ti-fifo-depth, and add the already documented

rx-fifo-depth and tx-fifo-depth as optional DT entries.

So I can change the driver and DT docs and test the RGMII device as 
above as long as we are in agreement
