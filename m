End-users in this context are users and not necessarily developers.

This is a reasonable expectation when a developers sends bpf patches.

It would be helpful understand what "help" is in this context.

What would be helpful is to write bpf tests such that older tests that
worked on older llvm versions continue to work and with some indication
on which tests require new bleeding edge tools.

It would be helpful if you can elaborate why latest tools are a
requirement.

Skipping tests will be useless. I am with you on that. However,
figuring out how to maintain some level of backward compatibility
to run at least older tests and warn users to upgrade would be
helpful.

I suspect currently users are ignoring bpf failures because they
are unable to keep up with the requirement to install newer tools
to run the tests. This isn't great either.

Users that care are sharing their pain to see if they can get some
help or explanation on why new tools are required every so often.
I don't think everybody understands why. :)
