Many thanks for the instructions! I decided to mark it as a fix, since
the problem is definitely there. I guess it just was not reported since
multiple RTL8169 devices are not often used in big systems with
multiple PCIe segments, and even if, there might be no collisions, by
sheer luck and virtue of a favourable bus enumeration.

Let me know if you disagree. At least I would like to see it in v5.10.y.

Sending v3 with the proper annotation in a minute.

Cheers,
Andre
