Hi Michal,
Thanks for your analysis.

Yes, it is hard to see the actual failing point because, I think it is randomly
failing in different places. I think in the actual case that causes the list
corruption is in fact in css_create().
It is the css_create() error path that does fist rcu enqueue in:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10.109/source/kernel/cgroup/cgroup.c#L5228

and the second is triggered by the css->refcnt calling css_release()

The reason why we don't see it actually failing in css_create() in the trace
dump is that the fail_dump() is rate-limited, see:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.18-rc2/source/lib/fault-inject.c#L44

I was confused as well, so I put additional debug prints in every place
where css_release() can fail, and it was actually in
css_create()->cgroup_idr_alloc() that failed in my case.

What happened was, the write triggered:
cgroup_subtree_control_write()->cgroup_apply_control()->cgroup_apply_control_enable()->css_create()

which, allocates and initializes the css, then fails in cgroup_idr_alloc(),
bails out and calls queue_rcu_work(cgroup_destroy_wq, &css->destroy_rwork);

then cgroup_subtree_control_write() bails out to out_unlock:, which then goes:

cgroup_kn_unlock()->cgroup_put()->css_put()->percpu_ref_put(&css->refcnt)->percpu_ref_put_many(ref)

which then calls ref->data->release(ref) and enqueues the same
&css->destroy_rwork on cgroup_destroy_wq causing list corruption in insert_work.

I thought so too at first as the the crushdump shows that this is failing
in css_populate_dir(), but this is not the fail that causes the list corruption.
The code can recover from the fail in css_populate_dir().
The fail that causes trouble is in css_create(), that makes it go to its error path.
I can dig out the patch with my debug prints and request syzbot to run it
if you want.

This change only prevents from double queue:

queue_[rcu]_work(cgroup_destroy_wq, &css->destroy_rwork);

I don't see how it affects the css_killed_work_fn() clean path.
I didn't look at it, since I thought it is irrelevant in this case.
