The default tcp_fin_timeout is 60s which may be too long for a server with
tens of thousands connections or qps. To reduce the connections as many as
possible, the system administer may set the sysctl_tcp_fin_timeout and most
of the connections would use the default timeout. The timeout may be very
sensitive. For example if sysctl_tcp_fin_timeout is 10s, 20s may cause double
the FIN-WAIT connections and server load needs to be reevaluated.

Besides from my experience a longer FIN-WAIT timeout will have a better
experience for clients, because thereâ€™re some clients, such as video player,
needing to finish the play before closing the connection. If we add a sysctl
with default/max timeout for all users, all connections should be set to the
max timeout except some special requirements which can also be set with
TCP_LINGER2 to use a smaller one.

Maybe my experience is not correct for your scenes, so could you describe
a situation that the timeout with default/max value is better?

Cambda
