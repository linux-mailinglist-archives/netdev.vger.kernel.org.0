Hi, is there any update on the plan for the networking track at
Plumbers (LPC) in Lisbon this year?  Last year there was a CFP, but if
there was one this year I can't find any mention or details.

Should we be assuming we are submitting through the normal LPC channels
and timelines for presentation proposals? Submissions close today if
that is the case. [1]

Thanks,
 Jesse
