That doesn't make this patch wrong, does it? It just doesn't cover
all use cases (which also wasn't covered before).

Fair enough, but this register doesn't seem to be implemented on
Zynq-7000. Albeit MACB_CAPS_USRIO_DISABLED isn't defined for the
Zynq MACB. It isn't defined in the Zynq-7000 reference manual and
you cannot set any bits:

=> mw 0xE000B00C 0xFFFFFFFF
=> md 0xE000B00C 1
e000b00c: 00000000

Also please note, that tx_clk may be an arbitrary clock which doesn't
necessarily need to be the clock which is controlled by CLK_EN. Or
am I missing something here?
