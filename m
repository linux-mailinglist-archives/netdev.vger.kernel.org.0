Greeting

I am Dr Joel Nikiema, I currently hold the post as the Audit Account
Manager of our bank in Ouagadougou Branch, Burkina Faso.

 I got your contact from a reliable web directory. After much consideration=
 In
developed the trust on you after one week of fasting and praying.

Due to the trust, I made up my mind to disclose this confidential business
to you.We are in position to reclaim and inherit the sum of US$15.8
Million Dollars without any trouble or hindrance from a dormant
account which remains unclaimed since 7 years ago, the owner of this
account died.

This is a U.S Dollar=E2=80=99s account and the beneficiary died without tra=
ce of his
family or relatives to claim the fund.

I am looking for a reliable business partner to present for the inheritance
This may not be your area of business but it will be another income
and benefit for both of us;
I will give you more specific profit details when I receive feedback
from you if you are interested.

Warm Regards
 Dr Joel Nikiema,
77577886
