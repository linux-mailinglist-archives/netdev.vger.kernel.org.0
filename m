This might be doable for some cases where the firmware is the component
assigning the PN values on TX and the firmware still being in a state
where the counter used for this could be fetched after a crash or
detected misbehavior. However, this does not sound like a very reliable
mechanism for cases where the firmware state for this cannot be trusted
or for the cases where the TX PN is actually assigned by the hardware
(which would get cleared on that restart and the value might be
unreadable before that restart). Trying to pull for this information
periodically before the issue is detected does not sound like a very
robust design either, since that would both waste resources and have a
race condition with the lower layers having transmitted additional
frames.

Obviously it would be nice to be able to restore this type of state in
all cases accurately, but that may not really be a viable approach for
all designs and it would seem to make sense to provide an alternative
approach to minimize the user visible impact from the rare cases of
having to restart some low level components during an association.
