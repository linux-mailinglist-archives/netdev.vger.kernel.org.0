As we must think in how most drivers work, which I am not knowledgeable 
of, I think that it is probably the best to think of the way mv88e6xxx 
works as an outlier.
If that is true, then I think the best option is to go with:
#bridge link set dev $swp1 learning off locked on
#bridge link set dev $swp2 learning off locked on

Then the cleanup side will just be:
#bridge link set dev $swp1 locked off
#bridge link set dev $swp2 locked off

The state 'learning off' is then consistent with the behavior of both 
the bridge and driver after the cleanup.
