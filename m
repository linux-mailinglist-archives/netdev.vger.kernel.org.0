In general I think this is a good idea (though maybe not with an skb as
an arg so we can use it easily within BPF), but I'm not sure if solves
the problem that Maor et al were setting out to solve.

Maor, if you did export bond_xmit_hash() to be used by another driver,
you would presumably have a check in place so if the RoCE and UDP
packets had a different hash function output you would make a change and
be sure that the UDP frames would go out on the same device that the
RoCE traffic would normally use.  Is this correct?  Would you also send
the frames directly on the interface using dev_queue_xmit() and bypass
the bonding driver completely?

I don't think I fundamentally have a problem with this, I just want to
make sure I understand your proposed code-flow.

Thanks!
