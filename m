CCing other lists and maintainers, hopefully, somebody would have a time to look at it...

Hello! I have not got any reply for this issue for 10 months and if you
are going to remove (or after these 10 months you already did it?)
existing HCI API from kernel it would break existing and working
userspace application. How do you want to handle such regressions?

I think that more people in past said that there should not be
regressions in userspace applications caused by kernel changes (e.g.
removing of API).

Also, could you please say something about root requirement for listing
supported codecs? At least clarifying something like

  "kernel allows only processes with uid=0 to access list of supported
  bluetooth audio codecs, effectively means requirement of bluetooth
  audio applications to run as root; and kernel developers do not have
  a time to discuss any future changes on this topic"

would be nice to know what is current state or future, so developers of
userspace bluetooth applications would know what should they do or
expect.


I really dislike this situation when after 10 months I just get
information that API for userspace is being removed without any
replacement and without any discussion how to handle issues and
transition period.
