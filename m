I believe there is a misunderstanding.

This is what I have understood from your previous comments in v1:
"This driver does not support transmitting anything else than
datagrams", which is what I assumed was a regular data packet. IOW,
sending a MAC_CMD such as a beacon request or sending a beacon was not
supported physically by the hardware. Hence, most of the scans
operations cannot be performed and must be rejected (all but a passive
scan, assuming that receiving beacons was okay).

Please mind the update in that hook which currently is just an FYI from
the mac to the drivers and not a "do it by yourself" injunction. So
answering -EOPNOTSUPP to the mac here does not mean:
	"I cannot handle it by myself, the scan cannot happen"
but
	"I cannot handle the forged frames, so let's just not try"

As a personal matter of taste, I don't like flags when it comes to
something complex like supporting a specific operation. Just in the
scanning procedure there are 4 different actions and a driver might
support only a subset of these, which is totally fine but hard to
properly describe by well-named flags. Here the driver hooks say to
the driver which are interested "here is what is going to happen" and
then they can:
- ignore the details by just not implementing the hooks, let the mac do
  its job, they will then transmit the relevant frames forged by the
  mac
- eventually enter a specific mode internally for this operation, but
  basically do the same as above, ie. transmitting the frames forged
  by the mac
- refuse the operation by returning an error code if something cannot
  be done

I've experienced a number of situations in the MTD world and later with
IIO drivers where flags have been remodeled and reused in different
manners, until the flag description gets totally wrong and
undescriptive regarding what it actually does. Hence my main idea of
letting drivers refuse these operations instead of having the mac doing
it for them.

I can definitely use flags if you want, but in this case, what flags do
you want to see?

Thanks,
Miqu√®l
