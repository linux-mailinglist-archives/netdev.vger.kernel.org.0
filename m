The I2C region belongs to the middle part of the total region. It was not considered to
split because the mother driver implement I2C bus master driver itself in the previous
patch. But is it suitable for splitting? After splitting, I get two virtual address, and each
time I read/write to a register, I have to determine which region it belongs to...Right?

I'd like to try it.
