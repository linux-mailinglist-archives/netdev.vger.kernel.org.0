In that case, it may be better to point to
6a5bcd84e886 ("page_pool: Allow drivers to hint on SKB recycling") too.

As even without fragment support, for below case:
to->pp_recycle    --> true
from->pp_recycle  --> true
skb_cloned(from)  --> true

It seems some page may be called with page_pool_release_page() twice if 'to' and
cloned skb of 'from' are freed concurrently, as there is data race between checking
page->pp_magic and clearing page->pp_magic.

Anyway, as it is merged already, I guess it is not really matter anymore.
