Not sure why TC is not a great uapi (or cli you mean?).
I'm not thinking it's a good idea to add another API when there is an 
API to do the same thing.

Yes at least I know a few examples in my company...
To me flower is easier to use compared to u32 as it can automatically 
dissect flows, so I usually use it when some filter or redirection is 
necessary on devices level.

I think the current XDP program for TC matches OVS as well, so I don't 
see such merit. TC flower and ovs kmod is similar in handling flows 
(both use mask list and look up hash table per mask).

I thought having single control path for offload is simple and 
intuitive. If XDP is allowed to be offloaded, OVS needs to have more 
knobs to enable offload of XDP programs.
I don't have ideas about difficulty in offload drivers' implementation 
though.

Yes but I'm unsure why it takes so much time. I need to investigate that...

Note that simple hash table (micro flows) implementation is hard.
It requires support for all key parameters including conntrack 
parameters, which does not look feasible now.
I only support mega flows using multiple hash tables each of which has 
its mask. This allows for support of partial set of keys which is 
feasible with XDP.

With this implementation I needed to emulate a list of masks using 
arrays, which I think is the main source of the latency, as it requires 
several syscalls to modify and lookup the BPF maps (I think it can be 
improved later though). This is the same even if we cross out the TC.

Anyway if the flow is really sensitive to latency, users should add the 
flow entry in advance. Going through userspace itself has non-negligible 
latency.

Yes as long as it is partial flow key/action support.
For full datapath support it's far from feasible, as William experienced...

I can understand the kernel code is more important, but if we determine 
not to have the code in kernel, we probably need each code in each 
userland tools? OVS has XDP, TC (iproute2 or some new userland tool) has 
XDP, nft has XDP, and they will be the same functionality, which is 
duplicate effort.

I think current code is already optimized for OVS as well as TC.

It should not as I explained above, although I should confirm it.

I have talked about this in Netdev 0x13 and IIRC Jesper was somewhat 
positive on this idea...
Jesper, any thoughts?
