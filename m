Academic writing is, of course, often highly specialised. We have  
editors with PhDs in all the major academic disciplines; many of them  
are still working in Oxford Proofreading Company and are up to date  
with the latest research in their field. So we're confident that,  
whatever your specialism, we'll find someone who speaks your language.

A professional proofreading service isn't only for lengthy pieces of  
work such as a dissertation or PhD thesis. Indeed, a good editor will  
produce remarkable results in the short form of an essay, transforming  
woolly, unimpressive writing into a lucidly articulated argument. For  
a university essay, this can make the difference to the grade you  
receive.
