That may depends on what is a PP pages and what is a non-PP pages, it seems
hard to answer now.

For a skb with ->pp_recycle being true and its frag page with page->pp_magic
being PP_SIGNATURE, when calling skb_clone()/pskb_expand_head() or
skb_try_coalesce(), we may call __skb_frag_ref() for the frag page, which
mean a page with page->pp_magic being PP_SIGNATURE can be both PP page
and non-PP page at the same time. So it is important to set the ->pp_recycle
correctly, and it seems hard to get that right from past experienceï¼Œthat's
why a per page marker is suggested.
