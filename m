This is an unintended consequence for sure. The bridge is persistent and
finds a leak in our defense, see __vlan_vid_add:

	/* Try switchdev op first. In case it is not supported, fallback to
	 * 8021q add.
	 */
	err = br_switchdev_port_vlan_add(dev, v->vid, flags, extack);
	if (err == -EOPNOTSUPP)
		return vlan_vid_add(dev, br->vlan_proto, v->vid);

We return -EOPNOTSUPP to br_switchdev_port_vlan_add, then the bridge
tries with vlan_vid_add, which makes us think it's an 8021q upper, and
we say "oh, yes, but sure!"

Btw, the fact that DSA thinks it's an 8021q upper is also the reason why
your VLAN gets added with different flags, see dsa_slave_vlan_rx_add_vid:

	/* This API only allows programming tagged, non-PVID VIDs */

There is a larger problem at hand, which is that the logic behind
dsa_slave_vlan_rx_add_vid currently adds VLANs to hardware even for many
switch drivers that don't need that. It does not even give the switch
driver the opportunity to distinguish between a bridge VLAN and a VLAN
coming from a VLAN upper interface. I need to think about that too.

This should work if you replace all:

	case SWITCHDEV_OBJ_ID_PORT_VLAN:
		if (!dsa_port_offloads_bridge_port(dp, obj->orig_dev))
			return -EOPNOTSUPP;

with:

	case SWITCHDEV_OBJ_ID_PORT_VLAN:
		if (!dsa_port_offloads_bridge_port(dp, obj->orig_dev))
			return 0;

but I need a bit more time to think of any drawbacks of doing that.

See above for the 2 corner cases that exist. The only reason why
dsa_slave_vlan_rx_add_vid() exists is to work around some hardware
quirks where some switches cannot put their standalone ports in
VLAN-unaware mode. So to accept VLAN-tagged packets, DSA needs to trap
the vlan_vid_add() calls to perform VLAN RX filtering on these
standalone ports. You do not need this functionality at all, but we do
not distinguish between switches that need it and switches that don't,
hence the issues.

I fail to see any reason why any external factors would modify the state
of a standalone switch port.

Even if you find the time to work on bridge offloading, standalone ports
should still behave like that: no learning, VLAN-unaware, no ingress
filtering, forward only to the CPU, flood all packets. You may find that
the switchover from one state to the other is a bit tricky, but it needs
to be consistent.
