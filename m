v4: no changes, update dependent series:
    https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-usb/list/?series=399561
    [v6,00/19] dt-bindings: usb: Add generic USB HCD, xHCI, DWC USB3 DT schema

v3:
  1. remove $nodenmae and items key word for compatilbe;
  2. add additionalProperties;

  The followings are suggested by Rob:
  3. merge the following patch
    [v2,1/4] dt-bindings: usb: convert usb-device.txt to YAML schema
    [v2,2/4] dt-bindings: usb: add properties for hard wired devices
  4. define the unit-address for hard-wired device in usb-hcd.yaml,
     also define its 'reg' and 'compatible';
  5. This series is base on Serge's series:
    https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-usb/cover/20201111090853.14112-1-Sergey.Semin@baikalelectronics.ru/
    [v4,00/18] dt-bindings: usb: Add generic USB HCD, xHCI, DWC USB3 DT schema

v2 changes suggested by Rob:
  1. modify pattern to support any USB class
  2. convert usb-device.txt into usb-device.yaml

-Generic USB Device Properties
-
-Usually, we only use device tree for hard wired USB device.
-The reference binding doc is from:
-http://www.devicetree.org/open-firmware/bindings/usb/usb-1_0.ps
-
-Four types of device-tree nodes are defined: "host-controller nodes"
-representing USB host controllers, "device nodes" representing USB devices,
-"interface nodes" representing USB interfaces and "combined nodes"
-representing simple USB devices.
-
-A combined node shall be used instead of a device node and an interface node
-for devices of class 0 or 9 (hub) with a single configuration and a single
-interface.
-
-A "hub node" is a combined node or an interface node that represents a USB
-hub.
-
-
-Required properties for device nodes:
-- compatible: "usbVID,PID", where VID is the vendor id and PID the product id.
-  The textual representation of VID and PID shall be in lower case hexadecimal
-  with leading zeroes suppressed. The other compatible strings from the above
-  standard binding could also be used, but a device adhering to this binding
-  may leave out all except for "usbVID,PID".
-- reg: the number of the USB hub port or the USB host-controller port to which
-  this device is attached. The range is 1-255.
-
-
-Required properties for device nodes with interface nodes:
-- #address-cells: shall be 2
-- #size-cells: shall be 0
-
-
-Required properties for interface nodes:
-- compatible: "usbifVID,PID.configCN.IN", where VID is the vendor id, PID is
-  the product id, CN is the configuration value and IN is the interface
-  number. The textual representation of VID, PID, CN and IN shall be in lower
-  case hexadecimal with leading zeroes suppressed. The other compatible
-  strings from the above standard binding could also be used, but a device
-  adhering to this binding may leave out all except for
-  "usbifVID,PID.configCN.IN".
-- reg: the interface number and configuration value
-
-The configuration component is not included in the textual representation of
-an interface-node unit address for configuration 1.
-
-
-Required properties for combined nodes:
-- compatible: "usbVID,PID", where VID is the vendor id and PID the product id.
-  The textual representation of VID and PID shall be in lower case hexadecimal
-  with leading zeroes suppressed. The other compatible strings from the above
-  standard binding could also be used, but a device adhering to this binding
-  may leave out all except for "usbVID,PID".
-- reg: the number of the USB hub port or the USB host-controller port to which
-  this device is attached. The range is 1-255.
-
-
-Required properties for hub nodes with device nodes:
-- #address-cells: shall be 1
-- #size-cells: shall be 0
-
-
-Required properties for host-controller nodes with device nodes:
-- #address-cells: shall be 1
-- #size-cells: shall be 0
-
-
-Example:
-
-&usb1 {	/* host controller */
-	#address-cells = <1>;
-	#size-cells = <0>;
-
-	hub@1 {		/* hub connected to port 1 */
-		compatible = "usb5e3,608";
