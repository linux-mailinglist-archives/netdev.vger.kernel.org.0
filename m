Jorgen, thank you very much!
This is exactly what I had in mind, explained much better :-)

We should look at the datagram header better because virtio-vsock uses 
64 bits for CID and port, but I don't think it's a big problem.

@Jiang, I think Jorgen answered you questions, but feel free to ask more 
if it's not clear.

Yes, I agree, it seems the right way to go.

Thanks,
