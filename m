Did we come to any conclusion?

My preliminary r8169 implementation now creates the following LED names:

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jul 26 22:50 r8169-led0-0300 -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/0000:03:00.0/net/enp3s0/r8169-led0-0300
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jul 26 22:50 r8169-led1-0300 -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/0000:03:00.0/net/enp3s0/r8169-led1-0300
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jul 26 22:50 r8169-led2-0300 -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/0000:03:00.0/net/enp3s0/r8169-led2-0300

I understood that LEDs should at least be renamed to r8169-0300::link-0
to link-2 Is this correct? Or do we have to wait with any network LED support
for a name discussion outcome?

For the different LED modes I defined private hw triggers (using trigger_type
to make the triggers usable with r8169 LEDs only). The trigger attribute now
looks like this:

[none] link_10_100 link_1000 link_10_100_1000 link_ACT link_10_100_ACT link_1000_ACT link_10_100_1000_ACT

Nice, or? Issue is just that these trigger names really should be made a
standard for all network LEDs. I don't care about the exact naming, important
is just that trigger names are the same, no matter whether it's about a r8169-
or igc- or whatever network chip controlled LEDs.

And I don't have a good solution for initialization yet. LED mode is whatever
BIOS sets, but initial trigger value is "none". I would have to read the
initial LED control register values, iterate over the triggers to find the
matching one, and call led_trigger_set() to properly set this trigger as
current trigger. Most likely this would need some LED core extensions:
- enable iterating over all triggers with a particular trigger_type
- enable triggers to have private data
Quite some hassle for a small functionality.
