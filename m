I've only used the BSP for a few weeks when I got the board last
year. The only thing I use from it is u-boot to chainload an upstream
u-boot, and boot Debian from there.

I never failed to get an IP address. Overall, networking has been
solid on this machine until this patch. I'll try and mess with this
when I get time, but that's probably going to be next week now.

ARMv8 forbid any sort of *visible* outer cache, so I really hope this
is not required. We wouldn't be able to support it.
