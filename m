Version available in the linux-firmware repo is also what big companies
(like google) receive for their systems... sometimes just only older
version as Marvell/NXP is slow in updating files in linux-firmware.
Seems that it is also same what receive customers under NDA as more
companies dropped "proprietary" ex-Marvell/NXP driver on internet and it
contained this firmware with some sources of driver which looks like a
fork of mwifiex (or maybe mwifiex is "cleaned fork" of that driver :D)

There is old firmware documentation which describe RPC communication
between OS and firmware:
http://wiki.laptop.org/images/f/f3/Firmware-Spec-v5.1-MV-S103752-00.pdf

It is really old for very old wifi chips and when I checked it, it still
matches what mwifiex is doing with new chips. Just there are new and
more commands. And documentation is OS-neutral.

So if Microsoft has some "incompatible" firmware with this, it could
mean that they got something special which nobody else have? Maybe it
can explain that "connected standby" and maybe also better stability?

Or just windows distribute firmware in different format and needs to
"unpack" or "preprocess" prior downloading it to device?
