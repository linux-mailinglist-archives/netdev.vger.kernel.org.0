I have experience and examples with pci aardvark controller. When card
is disconnected it sends synchronous abort to CPU when doing MMIO read
operation. One example is in this linux-usb thread:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/20210505120117.4wpmo6fhvzznf3wv@pali/t/#u

I can trigger this issue at least for xhci, nvme and ath drivers.

In case of pci aardvark it is not AER notification. And for MMIO read it
is synchronous abort.

Anyway, hotplug events are really asynchronous, but there is main issue
that this hotplug disconnect event instruct device driver to "unbind"
and e.g. these ethernet or usb controllers try to do MMIO operations in
their cleanup / remove / unbind phase, even when card is already
"disconnected" in PCI subsystem.
