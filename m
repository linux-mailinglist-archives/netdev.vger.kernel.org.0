The firmware folks here claim there's also a difference between TX and RX.

As far as I understand, the reason we attempt these is because it allows linking in more scenarios, presumably because some combination of things is not fully spec compliant?

Yea, understood, but respectfully, I don't understand why we should go
along with your requirement to support this non-spec behavior.
