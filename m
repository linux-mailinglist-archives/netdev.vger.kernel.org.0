+1 for the mount option.

I would actually do it the other way around: generating continuous sequential
tags by default and only reverting back to dense tags if requested by mount
option.

Is there any server implementation known to rely on current dense tag
generation?

If there is really some exotic server somewhere that uses e.g. a simple
constant size array to lookup tags and nobody is able to replace that array by
a hash table or something for whatever reason, then I am pretty sure that
server is limited at other ends as well (e.g. small 'msize'). So what we could
do is adjusting the default behaviour according to the other side and allow to
explicitly set both sequential and dense tags by mount option (i.e. not just
a boolean mount option).
