Thanks a lot for the reviews!

Do you mean a separate patch to fix the recalculation issue for
gate_close_time[tc] and budget[tc] in advance_sched()?

That makes sense. I will save the correction into a dedicated "correction"
variable, and make it use with the cycle time at other places, and not update
the oper cycle_time.

So that the taprio_dump() still shows the original oper cycle_time during the
schedule change pending period.

Yape, the queueMaxSDU and max_open_gate_durations() both should need to be
updated too. I will correct it in v2 patch by adding in the
taprio_update_queue_max_sdu() and taprio_calculate_gate_durations()
after the schedule change.

Noted. Will change it to sched_change_pending.

Thanks. Feedback taken.

Based on my understanding, here are the two cases when the Oper and Admin
cycle boundaries donâ€™t line up perfectly:-
1/ The final Oper cycle before first Admin cycle is smaller than
   OperCycleTimeExtension:
   - Then extend the final oper cycle rather than restart a very short final
     oper cycle.
2/ The final Oper cycle before first Admin cycle is greater than
   OperCycleTimeExtension:
   - Then it won't extend the final Oper cycle and restart the final Oper
     cycle instead, then it will be truncated at Admin base time.

I think you are saying the scenario 2/ above, right?
Let me rework the solution and come back with the proper fixes.

Agree. Let me fix up this comment in next patch.
