This question is for Boris, I think you we decided to get rid of the notifier
in V3 as all we need  to check is SHUTDOWN_SUSPEND state which sounds plausible
to me. So this check may go away. It may still be needed for sycore_ops
callbacks registration.

Yes but for now since things are not tested I will put this
!IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_X86) on syscore_ops calls registration part just to be safe
and not break anything.

If callbacks are not there, I don't expect hibernation to work correctly.
These callbacks takes care of xen primitives like shared_info_page,
grant table, sched clock, runstate time which are important to save the correct
state of the guest and bring it back up. Other patches in the series, adds all
the logic to these syscore callbacks. Freeze/thaw/restore are just there for at driver
level.
