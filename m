Attention.

I work in a pharmaceutical company.

I have a contract supply opportunity to be a contractor/Supplier to the pharmaceutical company.

The company always pays in advance for contractors to supply raw materials to the company.

These contract opportunities will help us to gain financial recovery from the negative effects of covid-19.

I will send you comprehensive details as soon as I get a response from You.
 
Thanks,
Mark Paulson
