This is a bad rebase.

For the network access-control, we can add a set of rules that allow to 
use a port number for a specific action.

We now have a ruleset with the first rule allowing read access to 
``/usr`` while denying all other handled accesses for the filesystem, 
and a second rule allowing TCP binding on port 8080.

``AF_UNSPEC`` sockets are handled as ``AF_INET`` sockets for the TCP 
binding action. However, connecting an ``AF_UNSPEC`` socket is always 
denied if at least one Landlock domain handles 
``LANDLOCK_NET_CONNECT_TCP``.  This restriction protects againstâ€¦

As commented in patch 8/12, I don't think this is the right approach 
anyway. It may then not be worth a dedicated section.
