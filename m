I'd prefer to not become the man-in-the middle, that just delays things
and is fragile; but I can do that occasionally if developers really are
unwilling to go to bugzilla.

Bugbot afaics will solve this, but using it right now would require me
to do something some maintainers don't like. See this sub-thread:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/1f0ebf13-ab0f-d512-6106-3ebf7cb372f1@leemhuis.info/


:-/

This got me thinking: we could tell bugbot to start monitoring this
thread and then tell the reporter to CC to the new bug bugbot created.
Ugly, but might work.

> I don't see them on CC...

Yeah, as stated in the initial mail of this thread: I sadly can't CC
them, because bugzilla.kernel.org tells users upon registration their
"email address will never be displayed to logged out users"... #sigh

I wish things were different, I'm unhappy about this situation myself.

Ciao, Thorsten
