The deadline is this Friday, please get your proposals in as soon as
possible and do not procrastinate.  The deadline absolutely cannot be
extended.

This is a call for proposals for the 3 day networking track at the
Linux Plumbers Conference in Lisbon, which will be happening on
September 9th-11th, 2019.

We are seeking talks of 40 minutes in length (including Q & A),
optionally accompanied by papers of 2 to 10 pages in length.  The
papers, while not required, are very strongly encouraged by the
committee.  The submitters intention to provide a paper will be taken
into consideration as a criteria when deciding which proposals to
accept.

Any kind of advanced networking-related topic will be considered.

Please submit your proposals on the LPC website at:

	https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/abstracts/#submit-abstract

And be sure to select "Networking Summit Track" in the Track pulldown
menu.

Proposals must be submitted by August 2nd, and submitters will be
notified of acceptance by August 9th.

Final slides and papers (as PDF) are due on September 2nd.

Looking forward to seeing you all in Lisbon in September!
