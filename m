The Programmable Real-time Unit and Industrial Communication Subsystem
Gigabit (PRU_ICSSG) is a low-latency microcontroller subsystem in the TI
SoCs. This subsystem is provided for the use cases like the implementation
of custom peripheral interfaces, offloading of tasks from the other
processor cores of the SoC, etc.

The subsystem includes many accelerators for data processing like
multiplier and multiplier-accumulator. It also has peripherals like
UART, MII/RGMII, MDIO, etc. Every ICSSG core includes two 32-bit
load/store RISC CPU cores called PRUs.

The above features allow it to be used for implementing custom firmware
based peripherals like ethernet.

This series adds the YAML documentation and the driver with basic EMAC
support for TI AM654 Silicon Rev 2 SoC with the PRU_ICSSG Sub-system.
running dual-EMAC firmware.
This currently supports basic EMAC with 1Gbps and 100Mbps link. 10M and
half-duplex modes are not yet supported because they require the support
of an IEP, which will be added later.
Advanced features like switch-dev and timestamping will be added later.

This series depends on two patch series that are not yet merged, one in
the remoteproc tree and another in the soc tree. the first one is titled
Introduce PRU remoteproc consumer API and the second one is titled
Introduce PRU platform consumer API.
Both of these are required for this driver.

To explain this dependency and to get reviews, I had earlier posted all
three of these as an RFC[1], this can be seen for understanding the
dependencies.

The two series remoteproc[2] and soc[3] have been posted separately to 
their respective trees.

This is the v3 of the patch series [v1]. This version of the patchset 
addresses the comments made on [v2] of the series. 

Changes from v3 to v4 :
*) Addressed Krzysztof's comments and fixed dt_binding_check errors in 
   patch 1/2.
*) Added interrupt-extended property in ethernet-ports properties section.
*) Fixed comments in file icssg_switch_map.h according to the Linux coding
   style in patch 2/2. Added Documentation of structures in patch 2/2.

Changes from v2 to v3 :
*) Addressed Rob and Krzysztof's comments on patch 1 of this series.
   Fixed indentation. Removed description and pinctrl section from 
   ti,icssg-prueth.yaml file.
*) Addressed Krzysztof, Paolo, Randy, Andrew and Christophe's comments on 
   patch 2 of this seires.
*) Fixed blanklines in Kconfig and Makefile. Changed structures to const 
   as suggested by Krzysztof.
*) Fixed while loop logic in emac_tx_complete_packets() API as suggested 
   by Paolo. Previously in the loop's last iteration 'budget' was 0 and 
   napi_consume_skb would wrongly assume the caller is not in NAPI context
   Now, budget won't be zero in last iteration of loop. 
*) Removed inline functions addr_to_da1() and addr_to_da0() as asked by 
   Andrew.
*) Added dev_err_probe() instead of dev_err() as suggested by Christophe.
*) In ti,icssg-prueth.yaml file, in the patternProperties section of 
   ethernet-ports, kept the port name as "port" instead of "ethernet-port" 
   as all other drivers were using "port". Will change it if is compulsory 
   to use "ethernet-port".
