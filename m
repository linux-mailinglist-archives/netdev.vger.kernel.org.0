XDP could.  But implementing TCP stack like prog could be hard, and more
than anything, this is actually a corner case (we quite often observe
this though), so applying such prog for every packet will cause a large
performance drop.

I think there is a tacit understanding in RFC that can be applied to
most situations.  Challenge ACK assumes a asymmetric routing between
peer vs attacker, but the assumption is not always true, and we have
a situation where RFC 5961 is rather harmful.

There is some knobs to switch on/off RFC behaviour.  We just want to
disable RFC 5961 here.

I'm reading this Maglev paper ( https://research.google/pubs/pub44824/ )
and the notable difference is that our Network Load Balancer does not
support DSR and ensure symmetric routing so that the response can be
filtered based on customer's configuration (of Security Group).

This issue can be caused generally, but I'll leave the explanation to
Jon.

CCing Yoshi from TCPM WG, I'm discussing this topic with him.
