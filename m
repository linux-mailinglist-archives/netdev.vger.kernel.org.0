Subject: [RESEND PATCH v3] seccomp: Improve performance by optimizing rmb()

As Kees haved accepted the v2 patch at a381b70a1 which just
replaced rmb() with smp_rmb(), this patch will base on that and just adjust
the smp_rmb() to the correct position.

As the original comment shown (and indeed it should be):
   /*
    * Make sure that any changes to mode from another thread have
    * been seen after SYSCALL_WORK_SECCOMP was seen.
    */
the smp_rmb() should be put between reading SYSCALL_WORK_SECCOMP and reading
seccomp.mode to make sure that any changes to mode from another thread have
been seen after SYSCALL_WORK_SECCOMP was seen, for TSYNC situation. However,
it is misplaced between reading seccomp.mode and seccomp->filter. This issue
seems to be misintroduced at 13aa72f0fd0a9f98a41cefb662487269e2f1ad65 which
aims to refactor the filter callback and the API. So let's just adjust the
smp_rmb() to the correct position.

A next optimization patch will be provided if this ajustment is appropriate.

ref:https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1614157085-18952-1-git-send-email-wanghongzhe@huawei.com/

v2 -> v3:
 - move the smp_rmb() to the correct position

v1 -> v2:
 - only replace rmb() with smp_rmb()
 - provide the performance test number

RFC -> v1:
 - replace rmb() with smp_rmb()
 - move the smp_rmb() logic to the middle between TIF_SECCOMP and mode
