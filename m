Mmmh all this is already done, isn't it?
- mac802154_trigger_scan_locked() stops the queue before setting the
  promiscuous mode
- mac802154_end_of_scan() wakes the queue after resetting the
  promiscuous mode to its original state

Should I drop the check which stands for an extra precaution?


But overall I think I don't understand well this part. What is
a bit foggy to me is why the (async) tx implementation does:

*Core*                           *Driver*

stop_queue()
drv_async_xmit() -------
                        \------> do something
                         ------- calls ieee802154_xmit_complete()
wakeup_queue() <--------/

So we actually disable the queue for transmitting. Why??

Yep, this is true, do you have any pointers? Because I looked at the
code and for now it appears quite unpractical to add some kind of
flushing mechanism on that net queue. I believe we cannot use the netif
interface for that so we would have to implement our own mechanism in
the ieee802154 core.

Thanks,
