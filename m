Hi Martin,

Sorry to have been responding so late,Â  I've been working on the 
link_update you mentioned in last week,
I have completed the support and testing of the related functions of it. 
and it is expected to be released in the
next few days.

As you mentioned, I do have much experience in kernel network 
development, so I plan to resend the PATCH in the form of RFC.
I really hope to receive your suggestions in next serials. Thank you.ðŸ˜‰

Best wishes.
D. Wythe
