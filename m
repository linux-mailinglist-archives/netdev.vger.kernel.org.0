Have you actually looked at Phonet or CAIF.

And netdev by default seems like repeating the same mistake we have done with WiFi. Your default context in LTE cases is only available when actually registered to the LTE bearer. It is pretty much pointless to have a netdev if you are not registered to the network.

You have to do a lot of initial modem setup before you ever get to the having your default context connected. Have a look at oFono and what it does to bring up the modem.

I think you need to provide actually a lot more details on how queue control inside Linux would be helpful and actually work in the first place. I donâ€™t see how Linux will be ever in charge and not the modem do this all for you.

I would just use sockets like Phonet and CAIF.

Frankly I have a problem if this is designed from the hardware point of view. Unless you are familiar with how 3GPP works and what a telephony stack like oFono has to do, there is really no point in trying to create a WWAN subsystem.

Anything defined needs to be defined in terms of 3GPP and not what current drivers have hacked together.

Marcel
