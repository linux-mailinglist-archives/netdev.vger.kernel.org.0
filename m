In my current implementation I don't see this as a real problem because
for me, there is no real difference between:

- a transfer is started
- we call stop_queue()
* right here a transfer is ongoing *

and 

- we call stop_queue()
- the counter is racy hence a last transfer is started
* right here a transfer is ongoing *

because stopping the queue and "flushing" it are two different things.
In the code I don't only rely on the queue being stopped but if I don't
want any more transfer to happen after that, so I also sync the queue
thanks to the new helpers introduced.

Please check v3 (which is coming very soon) and tell me what you think.
Maybe I missed something.

Most of the time the calling functions are void functions. In fact they
all simply hardcode the xmit_done helper and even worse, sometimes they
simply leak the skb. I've handled that already by updating all these
callers to be sure the only way out is to call xmit_done, which helps a
lot tracking transfers.

Also, you are right, we can certainly drop a couple of EXPORT_SYMBOLS
:-)
