Of the currently open syzbot reports against the upstream kernel, I've manually
marked 1 of them as possibly being a bug in the "net/ppp" subsystem.

If you believe this bug is no longer valid, please close the syzbot report by
sending a '#syz fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the
original thread, as explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed this bug to the "net/ppp" subsystem, please let
me know, and if possible forward the report to the correct people or mailing
list.

Here is the bug:
