Mjg59: You deserve to die, woman worshiping faggot (and wageslave).

Richard Matthew Stallman did nothing wrong.
He deserves an 8 year old child bride from Afghanistan (where actual 
good people exist).
White piece of shit (you).

Those of us who actually, in our own free time (not as a wage slave), 
write extensive Free Software are tired o you white wageslave faggots 
worshiping "MUH WHOITE WUHHHMEN" who do jack-all-shit (of their own 
volition) and yet are counted above us. We want you fucking people 
_DEAD_.

We are grateful that sometimes Talibs(students) make it happen.

This guy keeps writing *plonk* as a response of any pro-RMS comment.
He is a woman worshiping faggot who should be killed. His responses are 
also faggot snarky. He deserves to be tortured to death. May we pray it 
happens.
> Jonathan Kamens
RMS deserves a cute little 8 yr old child bride.
Jonathan Kamens disagrees and believes the white woman religion where 
men may not marry little girls. Jonathan Kamens deserves to die.
