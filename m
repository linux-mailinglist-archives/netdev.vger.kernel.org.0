First, how will you set this min_version? hordcoded in the kernel code?
Second, it will work for simple flows, but can be extremely complex
if your code looks like:
if (old_version)
 do something
if (new version)
 do something else

You will need to add logic to handle this -ENOPROTOOPT error value.

It will be nice to hear how distros decide to disable/drop the code.
