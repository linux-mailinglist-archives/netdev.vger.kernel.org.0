Kernel does not have code for A3700. Hence reason why there are hacks in
other drivers, like libata/ahci or usb/xhci.

In some cases rebuilt of firmware does not have to be possible (e.g.
when it it signed).

U-Boot for A3720 has its own implementation and does not use firmware
implementation (yet). So currently the only consumer of firmware
implementation is just Linux kernel.

Same argument can be used for any other driver which is implemented in
both bootloader and kernel... But I understand also your argument.

I think that whatever is used (firmware code, kernel code, ...), DT
should always contains full HW description with all nodes, and not only
some "subset". DT should be independent of current driver / firmware
implementation.
