Indeed but for this one the problem is the same with those who are
not much at ease with oral english. It's difficult to insert oneself
into a discussion flow between multiple people speaking fast and
naturally understanding what they're saying without having to think.
So this situation is not new, and actually this ability to interact
quickly is what makes such events profitable to a group, even if not
everyone can participate at the same level.

In such a case, it's the moderator's job to observe that some people
want to say something and probably need a second or two of silence and
concentration first. And this works both for local and remote ones.
