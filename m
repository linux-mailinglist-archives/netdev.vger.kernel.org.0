Yes, I got a student to add hooks for the Linux classification 
architecture (either adding more, or overriding the defaults) a couple 
of years ago, along with creating a classful structure. But his 
unfinished branch got left dangling once he graduated and is now way out 
of date. it's still our intention to take that direction tho.

You're right.

I've been away from all this for a while. In the tsvwg meeting there 
were perhaps a couple of dozen folks stating support and no-one against, 
so I had (wrongly) extrapolated from that - I should have checked the 
status of the ML discussion first.

That ship has sailed. You can consider it controversial if you want, but 
the tsvwg decided to use ECT(1) as an identifier for L4S after long 
discussions back in 2016. Years of a large number of people's work was 
predicated on that decision. So the dualpi2 code reflects the way the 
IETF is approaching this.

We're working on that - top priority now.

It is, but Olivier recently found the elusive cause of the problem that 
made later versions bursty. So we're getting close.
