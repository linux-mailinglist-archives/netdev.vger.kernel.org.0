The advantage of GRO_FRAGLIST for forwarding is that GRO and GSO
happen with almost no overhead, because the packets are left in
the skbs we received them and are not mangled during processing.

So if there is no hardware segmentation support, GRO_FRAGLIST is
still much faster than GRO_UDP_FWD.

Maybe we can make it exclusive for forwarding or bring the header
processing a bit closer to GRO_UDP_FWD, but I'd like to keep that
feature.
