With due respect, I am Mrs. George Olivia; I have decided to donate
what I have to you / Motherless babies/Less privileged/Widows' because
I am dying and diagnosed for cancer for about 2 years ago. I have been
touched by God Almighty to donate from what I have inherited from my
late husband to you for good work of God Almighty. I have asked
Almighty God to forgive me and believe he has, because he is a
Merciful God I will be going in for an operation surgery soon.

I decided to will/donate the sum of ($ 8.1 million DOLLARS) to you for
the good work of God Almighty, and also to help the motherless and
less privilege and also forth assistance of the widows. At the moment
I cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the fact that my
relatives (that have squandered the funds gave them for this purpose
before) are around me and my health status also. I have adjusted my
will and my lawyer is aware.

I wish you all the best and May the good Lord bless you abundantly,
and please use the funds judiciously and always extend the good work
to others. As soon as you get back to me, I shall give you info on
what I need from you, then you will contact the bank and tell them I
have willed those properties to you by quoting my personal file
routing and account information. And I have also notified the bank
that I am willing that properties to you for a good, effective and
prudent work. I know I don't know you but I have been directed to do
this by God Almighty.

I Have all my Hospital document which i can send to you as prove to
what am tell you and my seriousness to this. If you are interested in
carrying out this task, get back to me for more details on this noble
project of mine.

Yours Faithfully,
Mrs. George Olivia
