->

returns for instance drivers/net/ethernet/rdc/r6040.c. It invokes
r6040_interrupt() from the hardirq handler. Everything is correct.

This is the case except forâ€¦

the system was bootet with the `threadirqs' on command line.

correct. That is why moved them softirq context if the system is booted
with `threadirqs'.

If interrupts are forced-threaded, correct. From kernel/irq/manage.c,
irq_forced_thread_fn() is used as the "handler" in this case:
| /*
|  * Interrupts which are not explicitly requested as threaded
|  * interrupts rely on the implicit bh/preempt disable of the hard irq
|  * context. So we need to disable bh here to avoid deadlocks and other
|  * side effects.
|  */
| static irqreturn_t
| irq_forced_thread_fn(struct irq_desc *desc, struct irqaction *action)
| {
|         irqreturn_t ret;
| 
|         local_bh_disable();
|         ret = action->thread_fn(action->irq, action->dev_id);
|         if (ret == IRQ_HANDLED)
|                 atomic_inc(&desc->threads_handled);
| 
|         irq_finalize_oneshot(desc, action);
|         local_bh_enable();
|         return ret;
| }

This changes only if the `threadirqs' command line switch has been used.
We didn't have threaded interrupts 20 years ago.
Also, if the hrtimer was already expired at the time of programming then
the hrtimer used to fire in softirq context until commit
    c6eb3f70d4482 ("hrtimer: Get rid of hrtimer softirq")

This could happen if you program the timer to 50ns instead of 50us in
case you missed a few zeros in your echo to the sysfs file.

`threadirqs' threads only IRQ handlers. All of them. The hrtimers
infrastructure is not affected by this change. Also smp_function call
and irqwork continue to fire in hardirq context. Also the direct
interrupts vectors as used by the HyperV driver is not affected by this
switch but I think it should.

Yes. For those it does not matter because they use __napi_schedule()
which disables interrupts.

Okay. Looking now over all hrtimer in net/ look good, most of them
expire in softirq context. Looking at drivers/net they also look fine.
They acquire spin_lock_irqsave() within the driver, schedule a tasklet
or wake a net queue.
