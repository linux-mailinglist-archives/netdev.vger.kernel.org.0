compliment of the day,

i know this message might meet you in utmost surprise; however, it's
just my urgent need for a foreign partner that made me to contact you
for this mutual benefiting business when searching for a good and
reliable and trust worthy person. i got your contact email address
from a business directory and decided to connect you to this
transaction that is based on trust and your understanding.

i am mr.zachary jumbo i work with the african development bank adb
ouagadougou burkina-faso, i would like to know if this proposal will
be worthwhile for your acceptance have a foreign customer, mr.thomas
bahia from germany who was an investor, crude oil merchant and federal
government contractor, he was a victim with socata tbm 700 killing 6
people crashed on 6 december 2003 near paris leaving a closing balance
of $10.5 million united states dollars in one of his private us dollar
account that was been managed by me as his customer's account officer.

base on my security report, these funds can be claimed without any
hitches as no one is aware of the funds and it's closing balance
except me and the customer who is (now deceased) therefore, i can
present you as the next of kin and we will work out the modalities for
the claiming of the funds in accordance with the law.

now, if you are interested and really sure of your trustworthy,
accountability and confidentiality on this transaction without
disappointment, you can contact me and our sharing ratio will be 50%
for me and 40% for you, while 10% will be for the necessary expenses
that might occur along the line.

i expect your reply.

yours sincerely,

mr.zachary jumbo
