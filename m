Okay we really need to make a serious attempt to find a way to support
multi-buffer packets with XDP. With the important criteria of not
hurting performance of the single-buffer per packet design.

I've created a design document[2], that I will update based on our
discussions: [2] https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-project/blob/master/areas/core/xdp-multi-buffer01-design.org

The use-case that really convinced me was Eric's packet header-split.


Lets refresh: Why XDP don't have multi-buffer support:

XDP is designed for maximum performance, which is why certain driver-level
use-cases were not supported, like multi-buffer packets (like jumbo-frames).
As it e.g. complicated the driver RX-loop and memory model handling.

The single buffer per packet design, is also tied into eBPF Direct-Access
(DA) to packet data, which can only be allowed if the packet memory is in
contiguous memory.  This DA feature is essential for XDP performance.


One way forward is to define that XDP only get access to the first
packet buffer, and it cannot see subsequent buffers.  For XDP_TX and
XDP_REDIRECT to work then XDP still need to carry pointers (plus
len+offset) to the other buffers, which is 16 bytes per extra buffer.
