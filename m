Hi, Wenjia

This is really a situation that I hadn't considered before, and I'm afraid it can be a problem, if implementation of z/OS do need to process SMC_LLC_FLOW_RKEY
one by one, and i guess it's very possible.


> Sure, you can send the next version, I'll find a way to verify it.

Whatever, I will issue the next patches with first patch removed, and if we cannot pass the compatibility
test with z/OS, I think we have to give up the patch tried to running SMC_LLC_FLOW_RKEY concurrently.

Fortunately, we have discussed the possibility of protocol extension before. If the patch tried to running SMC_LLC_FLOW_RKEY concurrently
cannot be promoted temporarily, we can also promote it again after the protocol extension is completed.

Thanks.
