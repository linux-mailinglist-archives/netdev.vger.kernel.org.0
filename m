[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggestions
to make it better.]

Of the currently open syzbot reports against the upstream kernel, I've manually
marked 27 of them as possibly being bugs in the "net/xfrm" subsystem.  I've
listed these reports below, sorted by an algorithm that tries to list first the
reports most likely to be still valid, important, and actionable.

Of these 27 bugs, 4 were bisected to commits from the following person:

	Su Yanjun <suyj.fnst@cn.fujitsu.com>

If you believe a bug is no longer valid, please close the syzbot report by
sending a '#syz fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the
original thread, as explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug to the "net/xfrm" subsystem, please let me
know, and if possible forward the report to the correct people or mailing list.

Here are the bugs:
