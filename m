Subject: [PATCH v2 00/14] genirq: Cleanup the usage of irq_set_affinity_hint
Date:   Tue, 29 Jun 2021 11:27:32 -0400
Message-Id: <20210629152746.2953364-1-nitesh@redhat.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0

The drivers currently rely on irq_set_affinity_hint() to either set the
affinity_hint that is consumed by the userspace and/or to enforce a custom
affinity.

irq_set_affinity_hint() as the name suggests is originally introduced to
only set the affinity_hint to help the userspace in guiding the interrupts
and not the affinity itself. However, since the commit

        e2e64a932556 "genirq: Set initial affinity in irq_set_affinity_hint()"

irq_set_affinity_hint() also started applying the provided cpumask (if not
NULL) as the affinity for the interrupts. The issue that this commit was
trying to solve is to allow the drivers to enforce their affinity mask to
distribute the interrupts across the CPUs such that they don't always end
up on CPU0. This issue has been resolved within the irq subsystem since the
commit

        a0c9259dc4e1 "irq/matrix: Spread interrupts on allocation"

Hence, there is no need for the drivers to overwrite the affinity to spread
as it is dynamically performed at the time of allocation.

Also, irq_set_affinity_hint() setting affinity unconditionally introduces
issues for the drivers that only want to set their affinity_hint and not the
affinity itself as for these driver interrupts the default_smp_affinity_mask
is completely ignored (for detailed investigation please refer to [1]).

Unfortunately reverting the commit e2e64a932556 is not an option at this
point for two reasons [2]:

- Several drivers for a valid reason (performance) rely on this API to
  enforce their affinity mask

- Until very recently this was the only exported interface that was
  available

To clear this out Thomas has come up with the following interfaces:

- irq_set_affinity(): only sets affinity of an IRQ [3]
- irq_update_affinity_hint(): Only sets the hint [4]
- irq_set_affinity_and_hint(): Sets both affinity and the hint mask [4]

The first API is already merged in the linux-next tree and the patch
that introduces the other two interfaces are included with this patch-set.

To move to the stage where we can safely get rid of the
irq_set_affinity_hint(), which has been marked deprecated, we have to
move all its consumers to these new interfaces. In this patch-set, I have
done that for a few drivers and will hopefully try to move the remaining of
them in the coming days.

Testing
-------
In terms of testing, I have performed some basic testing on x86 to verify
things such as the interrupts are evenly spread on all CPUs, hint mask is
correctly set etc. for the drivers - i40e, iavf, mlx5, mlx4, ixgbe, i40iw
and enic on top of:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git

So more testing is probably required for these and the drivers that I didn't
test and any help will be much appreciated.


Notes
-----
- I was told that i40iw driver is going to be replaced by irdma, however,
  the new driver didn't land in Linus's tree yet. Once it does I will send
  a follow up patch for that as well.

- For the mpt3sas driver I decided to go with the usage of
  irq_set_affinity_and_hint over irq_set_affinity based on my little
  analysis of it and the megaraid driver. However, if we are sure that it
  is not required then I can replace it with just irq_set_affinity as one
  of its comment suggests.


Change from v1 [5]
------------------
- Fixed compilation error by adding the new interface definitions for cases
  where CONFIG_SMP is not defined

- Fixed function usage in megaraid_sas and removed unnecessary variable
  (Robin Murphy)

- Removed unwanted #if/endif from mlx4 (Leon Romanovsky)

- Other indentation related fixes
