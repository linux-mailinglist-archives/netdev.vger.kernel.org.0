Am not saying there is any issue with GUP. Let me try to explain the
issue first. You are aware of various discussions about doing DMA
or RDMA on FS DAX memory. e.g [1] [2] [3]

One of the proposal to do safely RDMA on FS DAX memory is/was ODP
Since its hooked with mm, it can block file system operations
like ftruncate on the mmaped file systems handle while ongoing IO(RDMA).

Currently RDS doesn't have support for ODP MR registration
and hence we don't want user application to do RDMA using
fastreg/fmr on FS DAX memory which isn't safe. So the intention
was, to make RDS_GET_MR fail if the user provided memory are is
FS DAX & RDS kernel module doesn't support ODP.

We have systems equipped with both regular DRAM as well as PMEM
DIMMs. So RDS needs to find out what kind of memory user is
passing to registers for RDMA. If its regular DRAM, it will
continue as now and return the key to application and if its
FS DAX memory, it  suppose to fail the call. GUP long
term was used since it checked fs dax memory and
reports -EOPNOTSUPP for fs_dax memory. Using that error
code, patch was making RDS get_mr call fail.

In short, till the ODP support added to RDS, we want the RDMA
request to fail for FS dax memory.

Hope above clarifies it.

Santosh
