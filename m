I believe I found another thing to be aware of relating to this.

My logic has been to do supplicant, then do DHCP, and only when DHCP
responds do I set up the networking for the wifi station.

It is at this time that I would be creating a VRF (or using routing rules
if not using VRF).

But, when I add the station to the newly created vrf, then it bounces it,
and that causes supplicant to have to re-associate  (I think, lots of moving
pieces, so I could be missing something).

Any chance you could just clear the neighbor entries and routes w/out bouncing
the interface?

Thanks,
Ben
