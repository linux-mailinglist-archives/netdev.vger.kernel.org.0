I personally prefer the use of macros instead of hardcoded values. 48 is the
last index of the table, i.e. it is ARRAY_SIZE(len2dlc) - 1.

For me, it is like doing this:
for (i = 0; i <= harcoded_value_representing_last_index_of_array; i++)
instead of this:
for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(array); i++)

Definitely prefer the later and (len >= ARRAY_SIZE(len2dlc)) is nothing less
than the negation of the i < ARRAY_SIZE(array) that we usually see in a for
loop.

I recognize below patterns to be correct:
   i < ARRAY_SIZE(array): check that variable is inbound.
   i >= ARRAY_SIZE(array): check that variable is outbound.

Anything which deviates from those patterns is fishy and it is actually how
I spotted the bug.

If we donâ€™t use ARRAY_SIZE() we lose that recognizable pattern and we need
to be aware of the actual content of len2dlc[] to understand the code.
(And I know that the table is just above the function and that this makes my
argument weaker).

So IMO, checks done against the array size should use the ARRAY_SIZE() macro
in order 1/ to make it a recognizable pattern and 2/ to make it work regardless
of the actual size of the table (i.e. no hardcoded value).

I would also prefer to use the CANFD_MAX_DLC macro here.

Vincent
