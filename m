OK. So looks like you are creating a function level aux device and a 
subsytem-level aux
device for each subsystem including ethernet.

Yes. I see that the intel RDMA patches are now submitted. We are 
creating an aux device to
expose RDMA functionality, butÂ  not planning to create an aux device for 
ethernet subsystem
on a PF/SF as the function-level pci/aux device can represent the 
default ethernet.
