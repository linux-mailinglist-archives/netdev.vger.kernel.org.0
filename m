FYI, I've done a fair amount of work (some already mainline as in all
the helpers for biovec page access), some of it still waiting (switching
more users over to these helpers and cleaning up some other mess)
to move bio_vecs into a form like that.  The difference in my plan
is to have a u32 len, both to allow for flags space on 64-bit which
we might need to support things like P2P without dev_pagemap structures.

Yes, I have some prototype could that takes a bio_vec as input and
returns an array of

struct dma_range {
	dma_addr_t	addr;
	u32		len;
}

Ð† need to get back to it and especially back to the question if this
needs the chaining support that the current scatterlist has.
