The input "merge right" approach might work.

Probably gact pipe action with counters can be mapped to the counter
action that netfilter needs. Is this a valid use-case you consider for
the tc hardware offload?

Yes, there might be counters that are shared accross rules, see
nfacct. Two different rules might refer to the same counter, IIRC
there is a way to do this in tc too.

You mean, in case that different counter types are specified, eg. one
action using delayed and another action using immediate?

What changes are expected to retrieve counter stats?

Will per-flow stats remain in place after this place?

Thank you.
