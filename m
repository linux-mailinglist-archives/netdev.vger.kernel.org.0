ifname is not atomic (first it creates ppp<id> interface and later it is
renamed) and have issues. Due to bug described here:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20210807160050.17687-1-pali@kernel.org/
you may get your kernel into state in which it is not possible to create
a new ppp interface. And this issue does not happen when using "unit"
argument.

To fix above issue it is needed to migrate pppd from ioctl API to rtnl.
But this would be possible only after rtnl API starts providing all
features, including specifying custom "unit" argument...

I hit above problem, so now I'm migrating all pppd setups from "ifname"
to "unit" option.
