This series is based on the patches from Tsuchiya Yuto which have been
submitted previously already, where it was suggested to cc linux-pci and
Bjorn to ask if there's a better way of doing those quirks.

Original series sent in by Tsuchiya: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/20201028142753.18855-1-kitakar@gmail.com/

Here's the summary written by Tsuchiya:

This series adds firmware reset quirks for Microsoft Surface devices
(PCIe-88W8897). Surface devices somehow requires quirks to reset the
firmware. Otherwise, current mwifiex driver can reset only software level.
This is not enough to recover from a bad state.

To do so, in the first patch, I added a DMI-based quirk implementation
for Surface devices that use mwifiex chip.

The required quirk is different by generation. Surface gen3 devices
(Surface 3 and Surface Pro 3) require a quirk that calls _DSM method
(the third patch).
Note that Surface Pro 3 is not yet supported because of the difference
between Surface 3. On Surface 3, the wifi card will be immediately
removed/reprobed after the _DSM call. On the other hand, Surface Pro 3
doesn't. Need to remove/reprobe wifi card ourselves. This behavior makes
the support difficult.

Surface gen4+ devices (Surface Pro 4 and later) require a quirk that
puts wifi into D3cold before FLR.

While here, created new files for quirks (mwifiex/pcie_quirks.c and
mwifiex/pcie_quirks.h) because the changes are a little bit too big to
add into pcie.c.
