I meant if no queues, it should be non-functional, which is an error.

I think the kernel module have all necessary information and it is the 
only one which have precise information of a device, so it
should answer precisely than let the user space guess. The kernel module 
should be reliable than stay silent, leave the question
to the user space tool.

same as above
