The second part is achievable by distros when they will decide to
support starting from version X. The same decision is not so easy
to do in the upstream.

Let's take as an example this feature. It will be set as default from
rdma-core v29 and the legacy code will be guarded by
"if (CONFIG_INFINIBAND_MIN_RDMA_CORE_VERSION >= 29)". When will change
CONFIG_INFINIBAND_MIN_RDMA_CORE_VERSION to be above 29? So we will
delete such legacy code.

In the world where we are not breaking user space, it will never happen.

It means that upstream doesn't get anything from those CONFIG_*s.
