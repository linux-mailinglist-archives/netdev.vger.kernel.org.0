HiÂ all,

I'm currently working on implementing support for the Management
Controller Transport Protocol (MCTP). Briefly, MCTP is a protocol for
intra-system communication between a management controller (typically a
BMC), and the devices it manages. If you're after the full details, the
DMTF have a specification (DSP0236) up at:

  https://www.dmtf.org/standards/pmci

In short, this involves adding a new protocol / address family
("AF_MCTP"), the supporting types for a sockets API, and netlink
protocol definitions.

At the moment, I'm currently at the design & prototyping stage - so no
patches to send just yet! However, if you're super keen, you can have a
review of the design outline for the OpenBMC project, up at:

  https://github.com/jk-ozlabs/openbmc-docs/blob/mctp/designs/mctp/mctp-kernel.md

If you'd like to send feedback on any aspects of that, I'm keen to hear
them. You can either respond to me via email, or participate in the
gerrit review of that document, which is at:

  https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/docs/+/40514

Otherwise, if you prefer to review as code instead, I'll be sending
patches to netdev once we've done a few passes of the design doc with
the OpenBMC community.

linux-can folks: the structure of MCTP is a little similar to CAN, and
I've been referring to net/can/ a little for the mctp implementation,
hence including the list here. If you have any particular hindsight you
have from your work, I'd be keen to hear about it too.

Cheers,


Jeremy
