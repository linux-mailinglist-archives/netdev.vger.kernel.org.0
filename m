	How do you "track the active slaves?"

	What I want to know is whether or not the RoCE code is going to
peek into the bonding internal data structures to look at, e.g.,
bond->slave_arr.  I don't see an obvious way to insure a duplication of
bonding's hash to slave mapping without knowing the placement of the
slaves in slave_arr.

	This sounds like a different explanation; above, you said things
are "modified globally in run time" but here the mappings are static.  I
don't see an explanation of how having the hash solves these problems,
or why it would be better than Jiri's suggestion of an .ndo or generic
wrapper.
