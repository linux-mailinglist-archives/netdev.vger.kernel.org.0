That would work, but it breaks my unfinished optimization below.  I was
thinking something more like "every time offset[i] is updated, check that it
gets smaller and otherwise barf".

Ya, I don't either any more.  Hopefully I just got confused between prog and
ctx...

I guess I meant to say "determines if it would be possible to make any
modifications next time".  I was thinking something along the lines of:

* as you run through the program, keep track of the shortest branch distance
* if you didn't remove enough bytes to make that branch cross a relaxation
  boundary, then you know that next time you won't be able to do any useful
  work

You're already computing all the branch lengths, so it's just an extra min().
Since we're assuming a small number of passes (after reversing the relaxation
direction), you'll probably save more work avoiding the extra pass than it'll
take to compute the extra information.  I guess some sort of benchmark would
give a real answer, but it certainly smells like a good idea ;)
