Unfortunately, the versioning doesn't work outside closed source world.
This driver version doesn't say anything when customer uses stable@
kernel, distro or its custom variant. I asked more than once to explain
how this versioning works, but got only marketing answers that not
backed-up by any technical details.

The driver version works in closed source products, but here it has very
distant correlation between real driver in use and reported.

So please, stop those driver version bumps in the upstream kernel.

If you disagree with me, feel free to revive the thread in the link
posted above and we will be glad to hear your technical claims there.

Till then, we have unified kernel policy, no driver versions.

Thanks
