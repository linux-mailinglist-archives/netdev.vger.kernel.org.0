I was also looking at all the __u16 in that header - borked.

Ok, so the intention was to avoid padding caused by the alignment
of sockaddr_storage rather than around the '__u16 spp_flags'.

I'd have to look up what (packed, aligned(4)) actually means.
It could force the structure to be fully packed (no holes)
but always have an overall alignment of 4.

It might have been clearer to put an 'aligned(4)' attribute
on the spp_address field itself.
Or even wonder whether sockaddr_storage should actually
have 8 byte alignment.

If it has 16 byte alignment then you cannot cast an IPv4
socket buffer address (which will be at most 4 byte aligned)
to sockaddr_storage and expect the compiler not to generate
code that will crash and burn on sparc64.

ISTR that the NetBSD view was that 'sockaddr_storage' should
never actually be instantiated - it only existed as a typed
pointer.
