Hello Sir,

I know it's an unconventional way of reaching out to you but it's 
for a good cause. I am glad we can share opinions and ideas.

I work with one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the 
UK. I have a business proposal which I am sure will interest you 
and I hope to receive your reply so I can send you details in 
full. I strongly believe it will interest you my friend.

I am looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,

Cornelis Pieter
