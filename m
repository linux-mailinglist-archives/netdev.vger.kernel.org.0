Dear friend

How are you today? I think a lot of time has passed since our last
communication. In any case, I will contact you again in connection
with our previous transaction, which was not successful for you.
Sorry, your cooperation with me cannot complete the transfer of funds.
I don=E2=80=99t know, maybe because you have to put up with your interest i=
n
the deal.

In any case, I am pleased to inform you of my success in receiving
funds transferred by a new partner from Venezuela. I am currently in
Venezuela for investment. However, I did not forget my previous
efforts and tried to help me with the transfer of the fund, despite
the fact that we could not come to a concrete conclusion. Thanks to my
efforts to help me, my new partner and I decided to reimburse you
850,000.00 euros so that you can enjoy joy and happiness with us.

I left your compensation visa with my secretary to help me send it.
Now contact my secretary in Togo, her name is Ms. Aliya Hakim and her
email address is (hakaliya7@gmail.com). Tell her to send you a $
850,000 ATM Visa card. I am currently very busy in Venezuela due to
the investment projects I have with my new partner. Rather contact
Aliya Hakim, tell her where to send the compensation visa. The card
will be sent to you immediately. I wish you the best in all your
endeavors.

Yours sincerely
Barrister Raphael Christopher.
