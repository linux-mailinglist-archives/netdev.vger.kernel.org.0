I had hoped someone would rely with an opinion on this, but nobody did
(and the reporter didn't reply to Lorenzo inquiry). So if you asked for
mine:

Hmmm. Tricky. This was the only such report I noticed. Giving that and
the risk that a revert might cause regressions on its own, I guess it
might be better to leave everything as it is for now - and re-evaluate
the situation in case more problems show up.
