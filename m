Well, they're also per station, we could just randomize the start and
then we'd delete the old session and start a new one, on the receiver.

So that would improve robustness somewhat (down to a 1/256 chance to hit
this problem).

I was on vacation, so yeah, quite possible I missed it.

Sounds like we need not just
4b08d1b6a994 ("mac80211: IBSS: send deauth when expiring inactive STAs")

but also send a deauth when we disconnect. Surprising we don't do that,
actually.

That's the situation though - the local station needs to know that it
has in fact *not* seen the same instance of the station, but that the
station has reset and needs to be removed & re-added.

Right. But we can implement the (optional) authentication (which you
actually already get when you implement [encrypted] IBSS with wpa_s),
and reset the station state when we get an authentication frame.
