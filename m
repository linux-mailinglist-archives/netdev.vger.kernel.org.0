Indeed this command will inform the missing required "[rt]x-internal-delay-ps".
I am not use to that command, as it seems to check all the devicetree each time
where I want only to check one.

You are correct.

Yes, it was the problem I got.
The PHY I use have RX delay enabled by default, currently the PHY driver does
not support delay configuration, therefore I let the MAC handle TX delay. I
have stumbling over that legacy/wrong DTS on the old Kernel.
