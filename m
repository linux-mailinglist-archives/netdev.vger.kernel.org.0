Hi Andrew,

okay, thanks so far. I'll look into the code. The GPIO configuration is 
a good point. I remember that we did something there (Normal SMI bit).

I removed all phy-handle for the internal ports and in the mdio part 
is only port 2 and 6 by now. But the Serdes ports are still not be
recognized. So maybe there is still something wrong?

Benjamin
