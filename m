Yeah, then I'm probably biased since I'm mostly dealing with Surface
stuff.

That might be an explanation. If it wouldn't need a heat-gun to open it
up, I'd probably have done that at some point in the past (there were
times when WiFi at my Uni was pretty much unusable with this device...
and I'm still not sure what fixed that or even if it's fixed completely).

I can only really repeat what I've been told: Apparently when they
started designing those devices, the only option with "Connected
standby" (or probably rather that feature set that MS wanted) was,
unfortunately for us, Marvell.

Interesting, I was not aware of this. IIRC we've been experimenting with
the mwlwifi driver (which that lrdmwl driver seems to be based on?), but
couldn't get that to work with the firmware we have. IIRC it also didn't
work with the Windows firmware (which seems to be significantly
different from the one we have for Linux and seems to use or be modeled
after some special Windows WiFi driver interface).
