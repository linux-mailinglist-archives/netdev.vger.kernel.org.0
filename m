Jozsef, I still have this issue on my list of tracked regressions and it
looks like nothing happens since above mail (or did I miss it?). Could
you maybe provide some guidance to Aaron to get us all closer to the
root of the problem?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
