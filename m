GSWIP (a new HW IP) is part of Intel Datapath Architecture drivers 
design for new Intel network/GW SoC (LGM).
Currently there are few other drivers (for different HW blocks in the 
datapath) which are still under internal code review.
Once it is done we are planning to submitÂ  staging folder.
Since the development is ongoing, we thought it is best to submit GSWIP 
first in drivers/staging/intel-dpa folder.
In the meantime, we will prepare a more detail TODO list for intel-dpa 
folder and a README to introduce the dpa.

Sure, I will resubmit my patch.
