It would means to read EEPROM two times unconditionally for every SFP.
With current solution we read EEPROM two times only for these buggy
RTL-based SFP modules. For all other SFPs EEPROM content is read only
one time. I like current solution because we do not change the way how
are other (non-broken) SFPs detected. It is better to not touch things
which are not broken.

And as we know that these zeros are expected behavior on these broken
RTL-based SFPs I think such test is fine.

Moreover there are Nokia SFPs which do not like one byte read and locks
i2c bus. Yes, it happens only for EEPROM content on second address
(therefore ID part for this test is not affected) but who knows how
broken would be any other SFPs in future.
