Sure, will split it into two. Also the problem with overflow is possible in
tls_sw_sendmsg(). But I'm not sure about correctness of freeing whole open
record in bpf_exec_tx_verdict.

Yes, it's a good idea to consume this error earlier. I think it's better to fix
tls_push_record() instead of dealing with it every possible caller.

So I suggest to accept Pooja's patch and will resend only ssize_t checking fix.
