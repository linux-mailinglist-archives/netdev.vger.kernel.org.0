Actually this is not ODP sysctl but really whether RDS supports
RDMA on fs_dax memory or not. I had different name for sysctl but
in internal review it got changed.

Ignoring the name of the sysctl, here is the application logic.
- If fs_dax sysctl path doesn't exist, no RDMA on FS DAX memory(this
will cover all the older kernels, which doesn't have this patch)
- If fs_dax sysctl path exist and its value is 0, no RDMA on FS
DAX. This will cover kernels which this patch but don't have
actual support for ODP based registration.
- If fs_dax sysctl path exist and its value is 1, RDMA can be
issued on FS DAX memory. This sysctl will be updated to value 1
once the support gets added.

Hope it clarifies better now.

Santosh
