Agree, it just helps in "most" cases to do this. Perhaps we shouldn't do
this then so that we find the problem more easily...

I think we should just implement authentication and reset of the station
properly, instead of fudging around with aggregation. This is just one
possible problematic scenario ... what if the station was reconfigured
with a different number of antennas in the meantime, for example, or
whatnot. There's a lot of state we keep for each station.

Well, it should learn about the station when there's a beacon from it,
or if not ... we have a patch to force a probe request/response cycle so
we have all the capabilities properly. We should upstream that patch,
but need to do something to avoid being able to use this for traffic
amplification attacks.
