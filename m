Yeah, this memset is pure stupidity, I'll remove it and this new
structure as well. Thanks for the suggestion.

These spaces are used for alignment, so the statistics will be readable
for end user. As far as I understood, these are minimum set of TLS
related statistics, with or without space it will remain same for end
user. Please let me know if I am interpreting it wrong.
 Â However I agree about the no_sync, I'll change it in my
next patch.
