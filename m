Another issue i see with networking is that statistic counters can be
dynamic. They can come and go. One of the drivers i work on has extra
statistics available when a fibre interface is used, compared to a
copper interface. And this happens at run time. The netlink API has no
problems with this. It is a snapshot of what counters are currently
available. There is no state in the API.

In my humble opinion, networking is unlikely to adopt your approach.
You probably want to look around for other subsystems which have
statistics, and see if you can cover their requirements, and get them
on board.
