I still think that check is not needed. We should get rid of it for
TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.

(and Ilya seems to have left Mellanox/nVidia anyway)

My bad, I kinda remembered they are from end of 2020. Anyway, following
that thread, I see you fixed my problem already.

The encrypted handshake portion is actually simple since it defines
really clear boundaries for the handshake traffic secret. The deployed
servers are a bit optimistic since they send you an unencrypted
ServerHello followed right away by the rest of the handshake messages
fully encrypted. I was surprised I can MSG_PEEK at the TLS record
header and then just read n bytes of just the ServerHello leaving
everything else in the receive buffer to be automatically decrypted
once I set the keys. This allows for just having the TLS handshake
implemented in userspace.

It is a little bit unfortunate that with the support for TLS 1.3, the
old tls12_ structures for providing the crypto info have been used. I
would have argued for providing the traffic_secret into the kernel and
then the kernel could have easily derived key+iv by itself. And with
that it could have done the KeyUpdate itself as well.

The other problem is actually that userspace needs to know when we are
close to the limits of AES-GCM encryptions or when the sequence number
is about to wrap. We need to feed back the status of the rec_seq back
to userspace (and with that also from the HW offload).

I would argue that it might have made sense not just specifying the
starting req_seq, but also either an ending or some trigger when
to tell userspace that it is a good time to re-key.

Regards

Marcel
