Ok, then it makes sense to set KEEP=0 and not override the port settings.

I wouldn't say "stupid", but it's non-obvious, hard to read and at the same time pointless.
I had to take out the abacus to see if I'm missing something.

Keeping just the comment is fine, but having the line of code is pretty
pointless. Just like any half-decent compiler will optimize it out, any
developer with half a brain will figure out what to do to parse
FID_EN ... LEARN_DIS thanks to the other comments.

The elaboration is right below. skb->offload_fwd_mark should be set to
zero for packets that have been forwarded only to the host (like packets
that have hit a trapping rule). I guess the switch will denote this
piece of info through the REASON code.

This allows the software bridge data path to know to not flood packets
that have already been flooded by the switch in its hardware data path.

Control packets can still be re-forwarded by the software data path,
even if the switch has trapped/not forwarded them, through the
"group_fwd_mask" option in "man ip-link").

On xmit, you have. On rcv (switch->CPU), I am not sure whether the
switch will ever set ALLOW to 1, and what is the meaning of that.
