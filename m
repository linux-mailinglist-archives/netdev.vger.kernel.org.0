Yes, CHID of 0xFFFF used for SMC-D loopback ensures the GID collision
won't involve ISM based SMC-D or SMC-R.

Yes, almost like this.

A very little correction: Token_A happens to match a DMB token in B's
kernel (not necessary Token_B) and Token_B happens to match a DMB token
in A's kernel (not necessary Token_A).

Thanks for the reference data.

IIUC, you are worried about the code implementation of fallback when GID
collides but DMB token check works? If so, I think we can provide a way
to set loopback device's GID manually, so that we can inject GID collision
fault to test the code.

SEID related topic will be replied in the next e-mail.
