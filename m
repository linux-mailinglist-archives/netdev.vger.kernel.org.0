With Connectx-4 Lx for example the netdev can have at most 63 queues
leaving 96 cpu servers a bit short - as an example of the limited number
of queues that a nic can handle (or currently exposes to the OS not sure
which). If I create a subfunction for ethernet traffic, how many queues
are allocated to it by default, is it managed via ethtool like the pf
and is there an impact to the resources used by / available to the
primary device?
