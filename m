Hello Dear,

I am Mr. Samuel Amar, A computer scientist with UBA Bank in Benin
Republic. I am 26 years old, just started work with UBA Bank I came
across your file which was marked X and your released disk painted
RED, I took time to study it and found out that you have paid
VIRTUALLY all fees and certificate but the fund has not been release
to you. The most annoying thing is that they cannot tell you the truth
that on no account will they ever release the fund to you; instead
they let you spend money unnecessarily.

I do not intend to work here all the days of my life, I can release
this fund to you if you can certify me of my security, and how I can
run away from this Benin Republic if I do this, because if I don't run
away from this country after I made the transfer, I will be Seriously
in trouble and my life will be in danger. This is like a Mafia setting
in Benin Republic; you may not understand it because you are not from
this country. The only thing I will need from you to release this fund
is a special HARD DISK,I will need two of this hard disk to recopy
your information from the corrupted one, destroy the previous one, and
punch the computer to reflect in your bank within 24 banking hours.

I will clean up the tracer and destroy your file, after which I will
run away from Benin Republic to meet with you. If you are interested.
Do get in touch with me immediately, You should send to me your
convenient tell/fax numbers for easy communications and also re
confirm your banking details, so that there won't be any mistake.

Regards,
Mr. Samuel.
