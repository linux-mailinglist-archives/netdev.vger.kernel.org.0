So this is question for authors of that commit 84e0f1c13806. But it
looks like I cannot send them emails because of following error:

<Minghuan.Lian@freescale.com>: connect to freescale.com[192.88.156.33]:25: Connection timed out

Do you have other way how to contact maintainers of that DTS file?
arch/powerpc/boot/dts/fsl/t1023rdb.dts

> PHY mode sgmii-2500 does not exist in mainline.

Yes, this is reason why I sent this email. In DTS is specified this mode
which does not exist.
