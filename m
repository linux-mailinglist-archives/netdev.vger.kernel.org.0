I use them a lot. It is not visible in this patchset, but in the
flashing follow-up patchset.

The relationship-by-name sounds a bit fragile to me. The names of
components are up to the individual drivers.

There is no new command for that, only one nested attribute which
carries the device list added to the existing command. They are no new
objects, they are just few nested values.

Give them a devlink instance? I don't understand how. LC is not a
separate device, far from that. That does not make any sense to me.

Does not make sense to me at all. Line cards are detachable PHY sets in
essence, very basic functionality. They does not have buffers, health
and params, I don't think so.

Is the FW version of gearbox on a line card irrelevand detail?
If so, how does the user know if/when to flash it?
If not, where would you list it if devices nest is not the correct place?

Yes, device 0 is "flash master" (RW). 1-3 are RO. I know it is a bit
confusing. Maybe Andy's suggestion of "shared" flag of some sort might
help.

UAPI is the "devices nest". It has to be list one way or another
(we may need to expose more gearboxes anyway). So what is differently
harmful with having list [0] or list [0,1,2,3] ?
