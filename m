More Qualcomm/Atheros wifi cards are broken in a way that they stop
responding after PCIe Hot Reset and completely disappear from the PCIe
bus. It is possible that similar issue have also these Marvell cards?

As now we know that bride does not support hotplug it cannot inform
system when card disconnect from the bus. The one possible way how to
detect if PCIe card is available at specific address is trying to read
its device and vendor id. Kernel caches device/vendor id, so from
userspace is needed to call lspci with -b argument (to ignore kernel's
reported cached value). Could you provide output of following command
after you do PCIe Hot Reset?

    lspci -s 01:00.0 -b -vv

(and compare with output which you have already provided if there are
any differences)

If PCIe Hot Reset is breaking the card then the only option how to
"reset" card into working state again is PCIe Warm Reset. Unfortunately
there is no common mechanism how to do it from system. PCIe Warm Reset
is done by asserting PERST# signal on card itself, in mPCIe form factor
it is pin 22. In most cases pin 22 is connected to some GPIO so via GPIO
subsystem it could be controlled.

Err... I have caught this part. Is proposed patch able to recover also
from state which happens after PCIe Hot Reset?
