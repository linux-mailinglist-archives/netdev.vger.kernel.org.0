 difference is in cable and terminators: they should be 93 Ohm.  Ethernet
 uses 50 Ohm impedance. You use T connectors to put the computers on a single

 A basically different cabling scheme is used with Twisted Pair cabling. Each
 of the TP cards has two RJ (phone-cord style) connectors.  The cards are
 then daisy-chained together using a cable connecting every two neighboring
 cards.  The ends are terminated with RJ 93 Ohm terminators which plug into
