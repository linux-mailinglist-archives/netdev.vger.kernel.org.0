Dear Friend,

I know this way of communication is not the most secured channel to
pass a message of this importance but right now, it is the quickest
means available to me, please bear with me.

My name is Richard Richoku, an Attorney at Law. This involves a  foreign
client of mine, who here in after shall be referred to as my client,
who died as a result of heart-related condition on November, 2012.

I have contacted you to assist in transferring the money left behind
by my  client before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by
the Bank where  this deposit valued at 6.7million dollars is lodged.
This Bank has issued me  a notice to contact the next of kin, or the
account will be confiscated.

My proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as the
next-  of-kin and beneficiary of my late client, so that the proceeds
of this account can be paid to you. Then we can share  the amount on a
mutually agreed-upon percentage. All legal documents to back up your
claim as my client's next-of-kin will be provided. All I require is
your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through.

Please contact me at once to indicate your interest. Do understand
that this transaction does require utmost confidence and you should
keep this mail to yourself not withstanding if you are rejecting the
transaction or accepting it.

Note that I reserve the right to reject your acceptance of this
proposal if I have reasons to believe that you may not be honest or
discrete as it  concerns this proposal.

Further details will be given as soon as your interest is indicated.

Best Regards,
Richard Richoku
