Instead of using userspace upcalls directly, it would be great if we could hide
behind a fuse-like socket type, in order to keep the kernel changes in fs/cifs (and other parts)
tiny and just replace the socket(AF_INET) call, but continue to use a
stream socket (likely with a few QUIC specific getsockopt/setsockopt calls).

It would also allow userspace applications like Samba's smbclient and smbd
to use it that way too.

With having the fuse-like socket before it should be trivial to switch
between the implementations.

The 4th step would then finally allocate a stable PF_QUIC which would be
ABI stable.
