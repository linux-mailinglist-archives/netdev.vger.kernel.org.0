Hi Sean,

Over the weekend, I've been able to eliminate these two with the
mac_select_pcs() method, and adding a pcs_validate() callback to the
PCS operations. The updated patches are in the net-queue branch.

... and over the weekend, I've implemented a flag "legacy_pre_march2020"
which is used to flag which drivers predate the changes to add PCS
support, allowing phylink to know whether they are legacy drivers or
not irrespective of whether they use a PCS.

So, I've updated the "mac_select_pcs" patch to allow NULL as a valid
return, and use error-pointers to indicate failure.

Then there's a following patch that adds a "pcs_validate" method which
gives the PCS an opportunity to have its say in the MAC validation
without the MAC having code to call the PCS - this change allowed mvneta
and mvpp2 to use phylink_generic_validate().

So, this is another step towards the end goal.

I'm planning to get lkp chew on the "legacy_pre_march2020" before I send
those out to netdev (which will be the next batch of patches), and then
will be the patches that add the ground work to allow DSA drivers to
become properly non-legacy.

Please have a look at my net-queue - are you happier with the
mac_select_pcs method now?

Once we've got this settled, and remaining drivers converted, my plan is
to kill off the old .validate method entirely. At that point,
"mac_capabilities" then becomes exactly that - the capabilities of the
MAC block irrespective of anything else.

Given bcm_sf2, I may need to add a method which allows the MAC to modify
those capabilities depending on the interface - bcm_sf2's pause frame
capabilities appear to be dependent on the interface mode. I'm tempted
to reverse the logic I have in bcm_sf2 in these patches - set
MAC_ASYM_PAUSE | MAC_SYM_PAUSE in mac_capabilities, and exclude them for
interface types that don't support pause frames.
