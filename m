For driver that does not have page pool support yet, the semantics seems
to be: always allocate and recycle local page(excpet pfmemalloc one). Page
reuse migration moves when the rx interrupt affinity moves(the NAPI polling
context moves accordingly) regardless of the dev_to_node().

It would be good to maintain the above semantics. And rx data page seems
to be close to the cpu that doing the rx cleaning, which means the cpu
can process the buffer quicker?

Yes, the performance is a concern too.
But if the rx page is closer to the cpu, maybe the time taken to process
the buffer can be reduced?

It is good to allocate the rx page close to both cpu and device, but if
both goal can not be reached, maybe we choose to allocate page that close
to cpu?

Yes, changing ring num or ring depth releases and allocates rx data page,
so using NUMA_NO_NODE to allocate page and alway recycle those page may
has different performance noticable to user.
