Hello,

It seems the problem can be reproduced easily. Is there some testcase without
hw dependency, so that I can reproduce the problem myself?

[VR]
Well, in my case, I produced it with the setup described below, which does include the Kalray board.
However, I am quite confident this has nothing to do with the board, not even with any particular Host NIC / cable, so that you can surely reproduce it in a different environment.
I think you just need to send some NVME-over-TCP traffic to any target able to receive it. In fact I suspect that any TCP traffic will do.
Attached is the fio test case we are running after doing the following nvme connect :
nvme connect -n nqn.2014-06.com.kalrayinc:nvme:ecca9057-4b59-5332-8d75-5acdcdd8a88e -t tcp -i 4 -a 10.20.0.1'      
And then simply
fio ./fio_jobs_randwr4k_60s.spdk


Which cpu is used in the testing? It seems the cpu arch's
memory semantic is importance when handling the rare case.

[VR] 
It's x86_64
FWIW, I've seen the problem happen both on native host and whithin a VM (be vcpu pinned or not, be fio threads pinned or not).

Hi,
