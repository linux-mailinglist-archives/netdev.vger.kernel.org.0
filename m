The ports are not interchangeable. Each has a specific purpose. Modem 
port is used for sending Modem commands and GNSS port for GNSS commands.

MTK architecture is defined to have Modem as part of the base-band 
processor and GNSS chip part of the Application Processor. MTK wanted to 
keep the architecture simple and common for SKU's that have GNSS 
solution or not. One example is the MTK's M70 which did not have a GNSS 
solution.

We have different architectures, some fully AT based WWAN modems, or 
fully MBIM, and composite Modems (where Modem interfaces go on MBIM and 
GNSS on AT). This falls under the third category where GPS control port 
(over AT) supports GNSS functionality. There are not standard MBIM 
commands for GNSS and thus GNSS is only supported over AT via MTK 
proprietary commands.

This has been discussed with ModemManager maintainer (Aleksander) who 
introduced MM_PORT_SERIAL_AT_FLAG_GPS_CONTROL, an AT port that is used 
purely for GPS control.Â  See Gerrit 
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mobile-broadband/ModemManager/-/merge_requests/753/diffs?commit_id=343f27a5e7b0226e10aec025c502703d0be9d1ac#0dbbdd1ea5ff4bb4ee5b3bd70e9bb0502e02eeea

Since the GNSS solution is part of the M.2 WWAN module, we believe that 
the GNSS port should be exposed by the WWAN subsystem and that 
ModemManager treats this AT port as a GPS control port.

Note that the GNSS port helps supports functionalities such as:
1. Start/Stop GNSS sessions
2. Configuration commands to support Assisted GNSS positioning
3. Crash & reboot (notifications when device is reset (AP) & host is reset)
4. Settings to Enable/Disable GNSS solution
5. Geofencing
