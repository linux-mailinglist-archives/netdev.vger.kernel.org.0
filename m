It looks like we are heading towards three different descriptions. OF,
ACPI and swnode. Each is likely to be different. OF has a lot of
history in it, deprecated things etc, which should not appear in the
others. So i see a big ugly block of code for the OF binding, and
hopefully clean and tidy code for ACPI binding and a clean and tidy
bit of code for swmode.,

It would be nice if the results of that parsing could be presented to
the drivers in a uniform way, so the driver itself does not need to
care where the information came from. But to me it is clear that this
uniform layer has no direct access to the databases, since the
database as are different.
