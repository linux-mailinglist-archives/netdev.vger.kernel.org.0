The codepath that replaces a policy by another should just trigger
on policy updates (XFRM_MSG_UPDPOLICY). Is that the case in your
test?

It should not be possible to add policy C with XFRM_MSG_NEWPOLICY
as long as you have policy B inserted.

The update replaces an old policy by a new one, the lookup keys of
the old policy must match the lookup keys of the new one. But policy
B has not the same lookup keys as C, the mark is different. So B should
not be replaced with C.

Looks like the warning is usefull, it found a bug.
