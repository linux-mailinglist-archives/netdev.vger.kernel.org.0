 Dearest,


 I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of
health, since I myself are in a very critical health condition in
which I sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the
next day.am Mrs.Helen John carlsen, wife of late Mrs.Helen John
carlsen, a widow suffering from long time illness.I have some funds I
inherited from my late husband, the sum of($ 11.000.000,eleven million
dollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious sickness which
is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.Having
known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to a good person
that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I need a
very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it
for Charity works,for orphanages, widows and also build schools for
less privileges that will be named after my late husband if possible
and to promote the word of God and the effort that the house of God is
maintained.

I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly
manner.That's why am taking this decision.am not afraid of death so I
know where am going.I accept this decision because I do not have any
child who will inherit this money after I die.Please I want your
sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute
this project, and I will give you more information on how the fund
will be transferred to your bank account.am waiting for your reply.

Best Regards,
Mrs.Helen John carlsen,
