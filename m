Huh, interesting... I haven't seen this feature before. What's the
intended use case? To never run _anything_ on those cores except
processes you choose? To run some things but not intensive things? Is it
sort of a RT-lite?

I took a look in padata/pcrypt and it doesn't look like they're
examining the housekeeping mask at all. Grepping for
housekeeping_cpumask doesn't appear to show many results in things like
workqueues, but rather in core scheduling stuff. So I'm not quite sure
what to make of this patch.

I suspect the thing to do might be to patch both wireguard and padata,
and send a patch series to me, the padata people, and
netdev@vger.kernel.org, and we can all hash this out together.

Regarding your patch, is there a way to make that a bit more succinct,
without introducing all of those helper functions? It seems awfully
verbose for something that seems like a matter of replacing the online
mask with the housekeeping mask.

Jason
