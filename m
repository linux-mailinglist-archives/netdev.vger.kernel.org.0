If this should be exported, this should be done from taprio, perhaps
adding a new field to what is exported via the dump() callback, which
should be quite easy.

In my view, having this as a "runtime" error is not useful, as we can
verify this at configuration time.

Hm, now I understamd what you meant here...

... if this is indeed useful, perhaps one way to do is to add a subcommand
to TC_SETUP_QDISC_TAPRIO, so we can retrieve the stats/information we want
from the driver. Similar to what cls_flower does.
