	You can also consider the idea of having 3 coordinates
for start svc: idx_svc_tab (0 or 1), idx_svc_row (0..IP_VS_SVC_TAB_SIZE-1)
and idx_svc for index in row's chain. On new packet this will
indicate the htable and its row and we have to skip svcs in
this row to find our starting svc. I think, this will still fit in
the netlink_callback's args area. If not, we can always kmalloc
our context in args[0]. In single table, this should speedup
the start svc lookup 128 times in average (we have 256 rows).
In setup with 1024 svcs (average 4 in each of the 256 rows)
we should skip these 0..3 entries instead of 512 in average.

	Yes, nobody is using such pointers. We should create
packets that correctly identify svc for the dests. The drawback
is that user space may need more work for merging. We can always
create a sorted array of pointers to svcs, so that we can binary
search with bsearch() the svc from every received packet. Then we
will know if this is a new svc or an old one (with dests in
multiple packets). Should we also check for dest duplicates in
the svc? The question is how much safe we should play. In
user space the max work we can do is to avoid duplicates
and to put dests to their correct svc.

	Ok, make sure your tests cover cases with multiple
dests, so that single service occupies multiple packets,
I'm not sure if 100 dests fit in one packet or not.
