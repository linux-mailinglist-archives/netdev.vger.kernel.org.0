In PCIe are all memory write requests as posted.

Non-posted writes in PCIe are used only for IO and config requests. But
this is not case for proposed patch change as it access only card's
memory space.

Technically this patch does not use non-posted memory write (as PCIe
does not support / provide it), just adds something like a barrier and
I'm not sure if it is really correct (you already wrote more details
about it, so I will let it be).

I'm not sure what is the correct terminology, I do not know how this
kind of write-followed-by-read "trick" is correctly called.
