No, in Xen initiated suspension backend doesn't take care of flushing
the rings, the frontend has a shadow copy of the ring contents and it
re-issues the requests on resume.

AFAICT you don't wait for the in-flight requests to be finished, and
just rely on blkback to finish processing those. I'm not sure all
blkback implementations out there can guarantee that.

The approach used by Xen initiated suspension is to re-issue the
in-flight requests when resuming. I have to admit I don't think this
is the best approach, but I would like to keep both the Xen and the PM
initiated suspension using the same logic, and hence I would request
that you try to re-use the existing resume logic (blkfront_resume).

Oh, so blk_mq_freeze_queue does wait for in-flight requests to be
finished. I guess it's fine then.

That's fine, but I would still like to requests that you use the same
logic (as much as possible) for both the Xen and the PM initiated
suspension.

So you either apply this freeze/unfreeze to the Xen suspension (and
drop the re-issuing of requests on resume) or adapt the same approach
as the Xen initiated suspension. Keeping two completely different
approaches to suspension / resume on blkfront is not suitable long
term.

Thanks, Roger.
