Hi Greg,

I am grateful for your help.

Both ccmni change and networking changes are needed, because as far
as I know, usually a device type should have at least one device to
use it, and pureip is what the ccmni driver needs, so I uploaded the
networking change and ccmni driver together;

Since MTKâ€™s modem driver has a large amount of code and strong code
coupling, it takes some time to clean up them. At this stage, it may
be difficult to upstream all the codes together.

During this period, even if ccmni is incomplete, can I put the ccmni
driver initial code in the driver/staging first ? After that, we will
gradually implement more functions of ccmni in the staging tree, and
we can also gradually sort out and clean up modem driver in the staging.

In addition, due to the requirements of GKI 2.0, if ccmni device
uses RAWIP or NONE, it will hit ipv6 issue; and if ccmni uses
a device type other than PUREIP/RAWIP/NONE, there will be tethering
ebpf offload or clat ebpf offload can not work problems.

I hope PUREIP and ccmni can be accepted by the Linux community.

Thanks,
Rocco
