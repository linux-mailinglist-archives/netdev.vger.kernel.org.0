Hi Ben,
Intel has in the past programmed BMC MACs with an offset from the system 
MAC address of the first shared interface. We have found this approach 
causes problems and adds complexity when system interfaces / OCP cards 
are added or removed or disabled in BIOS. Our approach in OpenBMC is to 
keep this simple - provide means for the BMC MAC addresses to be set in 
manufacturing and persist them.

We do also have some of the same use cases you mention.
Thanks,
Terry
