How this is guaranteed? Do you see errors when calling nla_put_xxx() twice?

For example,
1. When migrate the VM to a node which has a more resourceful device. If 
the source side device does not have MQ, RSS or TSO feature, the vDPA 
device assigned to the VM does not
have MQ, RSS or TSO as well. When migrating to a node which has a device 
with MQ, RSS or TSO, to provide a consistent network device to the 
guest, to be transparent to the guest,
we need to mask out MQ, RSS or TSO in the vDPA device when provisioning. 
This is an example that management device may have different feature 
bits than the vDPA device.

2.SIOV, if a virtio device is capable of managing SIOV devices, and it 
exposes this capability by a feature bit(Like what I am doing in the 
"transport virtqueue"),
we don't want the SIOV ADIs have SIOV features, so the ADIs don't have 
SIOV feature bit.
