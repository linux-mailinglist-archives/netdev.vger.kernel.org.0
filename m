Your  summary seems way off the mark to me, and I suggest you ask Wes Eddy for an actual summary of the current status ...

There's a relatively low threshold for adding RFC-compliant network algorithms to Linux, and it is certainly not required to have a published RFC specifically describing each qdisc's operating principles before it can be upstreamed.  It just so happens that fq_codel (and some other notable algorithms such as CUBIC) proved sufficiently useful in practice to warrant post-hoc documentation in RFC form.

The L4S Internet Drafts have *just failed* an IETF WGLC, which means they are *not* advancing to publication as RFCs in their current form.

The WG chairs strongly suggest that the revisions include limiting the scope and impact of initial L4S experiments on RFC 3168 functionality (both existing usage and potential deployment) to ensure that the L4S experiments are safe to perform on the Internet, paying particular attention to potential impacts on networks and users that are not participating in the L4S experiments.
