Is this based on something that Arista has had running for a while now 
or is a recent new development?

My implementation started with per-socket lists but switched to a global 
list because this way is much easier to manage from userspace. In 
practice userspace apps will want to ensure that all sockets use the 
same set of keys anyway.

My series doesn't try to prevent inconsistencies inside the key lists 
because it's not clear that the kernel should prevent userspace from 
shooting itself in the foot. Worst case is connection failure on 
misconfiguration which seems fine.

The RFC doesn't specify in detail how key management is to be performed, 
for example if two valid keys are available it doesn't mention which one 
should be used. Some guidance is found in RFC8177 but again not very much.

I implemented an ABI that can be used by userspace for RFC8177-style key 
management and asked for feedback but received very little. If you had 
come with a clear ABI proposal I would have tried to implement it.

Here's a link to our older discussion:

https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/e7f0449a-2bad-99ad-4737-016a0e6b8b84@gmail.com/

Seeing an entirely distinct unrelated implementation is very unexpected. 
What made you do this?
