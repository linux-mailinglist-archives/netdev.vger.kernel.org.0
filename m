Hi Vladimir

I took a quick look at the data sheet. It says in section 2.1.5
Management:

  External access to registers through PCIe, SPI, MIIM, or through an
  Ethernet port with inline Microsemiâ€™s Versatile Register Access
  Protocol (VRAP)

So maybe the basic 7512 support should be separate from how you access
the registers, so that somebody can later add MMIO or MDIO support?

    Andrew

P.S.

I did not know about VRAP. Marvell has something similar. It would be
nice to put together some shared generic code to support
this. Statistics would really benefit from it.
