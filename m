Dear friend,

My name is Ms. Lori from USA. I work as a Foreign Operations Manager
at a reputable bank. I am the account manager for one of our deceased
clients, an oil and gas contractor who died of a heart attack in 2012.
He had a fixed deposit account with our bank worth $6.3 million. And
he didn't specify a next heir when he opened the account. He died
without any closest registered relative as he had been divorced for a
long time and had no children. I decided to contact you for our mutual
benefit, knowing that you have the same last name as my deceased
client.

I am very pleased to see your name and I look forward to your
cooperation in presenting you as the next successor to this fund and I
guarantee that this will be done under a legitimate arrangement that
will protect us from any breach of the law. And for your participation
in this transaction, you will receive 50% after the money is
transferred to you, and 50% for me. If you are interested, please
contact me for more procedures.
