No, I don't think that's the right thing to do. A patch breaks a
driver, and the author of the patch is not in a position to fix it.
That's OK, these things happen, it's just bad timing.

But I don't understand this part of the kernel well enough to submit a
patch based on a sample of *one*, at the last minute, just because "it
works for me", and have the confidence that it doesn't break anything
else.

I have now posted a revert of the original patch[1]. I'll be happy to
work with you, with a less pressure, in order to have something that
works for everyone in the next cycle.

Thanks,

	M.
