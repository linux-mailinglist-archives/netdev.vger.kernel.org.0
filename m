Hi Sherry (and Sebastian and Netdev and Tejun and whomever),

I'm top-replying so that I can provide an overview of what's up to other
readers, and then I'll leave your email below for additional context.

random.c used to have a hard IRQ handler that did something like this:

    do_some_stuff()
    spin_lock()
    do_some_other_stuff()
    spin_lock()

That worked fine, but Sebastian pointed out that having spinlocks in a
hard IRQ handler was a big no-no for RT. Not wanting to make those into
raw spinlocks, he suggested we hoist things into a workqueue. So that's
what we did together, and now that function reads:

    do_some_stuff()
    queue_work_on(raw_smp_processor_id(), other_stuff_worker);

That seemed reasonable to me -- it's a pattern practiced a million times
all over the kernel -- and is currently how random.c's
add_interrupt_randomness() functions.

Sherry, however, has reported a ~10% performance regression using qperf
with TCP over some heavy duty infiniband cards. According to Sherry's
tests, removing the call to queue_work_on() makes the performance
regression go away.

That leads me to suspect that queue_work_on() might actually not be as
cheap as I assumed? If so, is that surprising to anybody else? And what
should we do about this?

Unfortunately, as you'll see from reading below, I'm hopeless in trying
to recreate Sherry's test rig, and even Sherry was unable to reproduce
it on different hardware. Nonetheless, a 10% regression on fancy 40gbps
hardware seems like something worthy of wider concern.

What are our options? Investigate queue_work_on() bottlenecks? Move back
to the original pattern, but use raw spinlocks? Some thing else?

Sherry -- are you able to do a bit of profiling to see which
instructions or which area of a function is the hottest or creating that
bottleneck? I think we probably need more information to do something
with this.

Also, because I still have no idea how I can reproduce this myself, you
might need to take the reigns with helping to develop and test a patch,
since I'm kind of stabbing in the dark here.

Anyway, because this might be rather involved, I figure it's best to
move this conversation on list in case other folks have insights.

Regards,
Jason
