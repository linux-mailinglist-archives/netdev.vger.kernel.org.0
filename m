Agreed, tbh, it's not clear to me either atm. :) The SKB_MAX_ALLOC constant itself
should be replaced with something more appropriate. Also as a small side note,
the !skb->dev check should be removed since in tc ingress/egress the skb->dev
is never NULL. (See also tc_cls_act_convert_ctx_access() on struct __sk_buff,
ifindex conversion.)

Right, agree on tc ingress side when skb goes further up the stack.

You mean whether the check should be inside __dev_queue_xmit() itself
instead? Maybe. From a cursory glance the MTU checks are spread in upper
layer protos. As mentioned, we would need to have coverage for BPF progs
attached on the tc ingress and egress (sch_handle_{ingress,egress}())
hook where for each case an skb can be just TC_ACT_OK'ed (up to stack or
down to driver), redirected via ____dev_forward_skb() or dev_queue_xmit().
The ____dev_forward_skb() has us covered and for TC_ACT_OK on tc ingress,
we'd only need a generic upper cap. So for the rest of the cases, we'd
need to have some sort of sanity check somewhere.

Yeah, it probably would for QinQ which is probably why noone was running
into it so far. At least the skb_vlan_push() would first store the tag
via __vlan_hwaccel_put_tag() in the skb itself.

Ok, makes sense. Thanks for looking into it!
