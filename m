I don't think this is true.  The path from 00:01.2 to 04:00.x includes
two Links, and they are independent.  The exit latency for each Link
depends only on the Port at each end:

  Link 1 (depends on 00:01.2 and 01:00.0): max(32, 32) = 32us
  Link 2 (depends on 02:04.0 and 04:00.x): max(32, 64) = 64us

If L1 is enabled for Link 1 and disabled for Link 2, Link 2 will
remain in L0 so it has no L1 exit latency, and the exit latency of
the entire path should be 32us.

I think you're using "the full link" to refer to the entire path from
00:01.2 to 04:00.x.  In PCIe, a "Link" directly connects two Ports.
It doesn't refer to the entire path.

No, if L1 is disabled on 02:04.0 and 04:00.x (as Linux apparently does
by default), the Link between them never enters L1, so there is no
power-on for this Link.

It would be pointless for a device to advertise L1 support if it could
never be used.  04:00.0 advertises that it can tolerate L1 latency of
64us and that it can exit L1 in 64us or less.  So it *can* be behind a
Link in L1 as long as nothing else in the path adds more latency.

I think you're saying we need to include L1 exit latency even for
Links where L1 is disabled.  I don't think we should include those.

Yes, as I said, we should be able to enable L1 on either of the Links
in the path to 04:00.x, but not both.

The original problem here is not with the Realtek device at 04:00.x
but with the I211 NIC at 03:00.0.  So we also need to figure out what
the connection is.  Does the same I211 performance problem occur if
you remove the Realtek device from the system?

03:00.0 can tolerate 64us of latency, so even if L1 is enabled on both
Links leading to it, the path exit latency would be <33us, which
should be fine.
