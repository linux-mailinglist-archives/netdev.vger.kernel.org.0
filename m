Correct, the ibmveth device, unlike ibmvnic, receives no signal or 
notification at all in the event of a partition migration, so it can not 
handle it or send a gratuitous ARP because from the driver's perspective 
nothing has changed.Â  As you've described, there is no existing notifier 
in the kernel to inform interested parties that the system has migrated 
or is about to migrate. Without adding the needed infrastructure to do 
that, I'm not sure how else to fix this.
