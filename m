If you look at who uses sendpage outside the networking layer itself
you see that it is basically block driver and file systems.  These
have no way to control what memory they get passed and have to deal
with everything someone throws at them.

So for these callers the requirements are in order of importance:

 (1) just send the damn page without generating weird OOPSes
 (2) do so as fast as possible
 (3) do so without requÑ–ring pointless boilerplate code

Any I think the current interface fails these requirements really badly.
Having a helper that just does the right thing would really help all of
these users, including those currently using raw ->sendpage over
kernel_sendpage.  If you don't like kernel_sendpage to just do the
right thing we could just add another helper, e.g.
kernel_sendpage_or_fallback, but that would seem a little pointless
to me.
