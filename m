Greetings,

I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never
met before, but need not to worry as I am contacting you independently
of my investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I
need your cooperation in transferring the sum of $11.3million to your
private account. The money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for
years without anybody coming for the claim.

I want to release the money to you as the relative to our deceased
customer (the account owner) who died a long with his supposed Next Of
Kin in October 2005. The banking law and guideline here stipulates
that if such money remains unclaimed after 17 years, the money will be
transferred into the bank treasury as an unclaimed fund.

By indicating your interest I will send you the full details on how
the business will be executed.

Please respond urgently and delete if you are not interested.

Best regards,
Mr. Michael Duku.
