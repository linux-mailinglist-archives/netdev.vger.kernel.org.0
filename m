Totally not a lawyer either, but:

There's (generally, in many jurisdictions, etc), a minimum bar for when
something is considered a "creative work" and thus copyrightable. Debug
output *could* fall short of this (and thus not be copyrightable at
all). It could also fall under the same "API" umbrella as that famous
Google v Oracle case. Or it could fall under the "syscall exception" of
the kernel source.

I guess it would take a court decision to know either way. IMO it would
make sense if vmlinux.h is not copyrightable for whatever reason, but,
again, IANAL :)

Anyway, while we obviously can't resolve legal matters on the mailing,
we can express the *intention* of the community, which is what the
licensing document is trying to do. So it totally makes sense to mention
vmlinux.h here; the question is what should such a text say?
