Dear Fund Owner,

I am Nigel Higgins, the current Group Chairman Of Barclays Bank Plc,
London England. Refer to my previous emails informing you over and
over again that your inheritance payment of 10.5 Million USD only has
been irrevocably approved to be paid to you. Despite my repeated
reminders, nothing has been heard from you.

After analyzing your silence to maybe as a result of the Global
Pandemic, the management of the Bank decided that your earned interest
of 1.5 Million USD only should be released to you so that you could
have cash at hand to activate the account where your principal amount
has been protected for your online use.

Conclusively, your interest earned 1.5 Million USD Only is ready to be
paid to you by cashier's check or ATM Debit Card depending on your
choice as soon as you reconfirm your address and direct telephone
number while your principal amount of 10.5 Million USD Only is still
protected in the account that was established with your data pending
when you can provide the amount required to activate the account to
make it functional and operational for your use.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Yours sincerely,

Nigel Higgins, (Group Chairman),
Barclays Bank Plc,
