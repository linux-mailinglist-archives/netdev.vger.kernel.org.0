I don't see the "eth0" name referenced in any of the attached files. By
"connected to the i.MX8MN" you mean "separate from the board under test",
right? To be more specific, it is always connected to the eth2 switch
port, correct?

"Flows correctly" with vlan_filtering=1? (netconfig_mausezahn_test1.sh, right)?

Which test case is this? Both test1 and test2 are fully VLAN-aware from
the start.

What happens after 30 seconds? PTP traffic disappears? Is the bridge
still VLAN-unaware when this happens?

> - PTP traffic does not appear on the VLAN-aware br0 interface

The collected statistics are a bit noisy. The $(after - before) for
in_multicasts is 1400, and for out_multicasts is 1026. So it appears
that multicast traffic is flowing bidirectionally. Could you either stop
the other sources of traffic while repeating the experiment, or send a
higher number of mausezahn packets, so they stand out more clearly in
the delta? The mausezahn packets should have the same basic characteristics
to the switch as the PTP traffic, so you shouldn't need PTP to figure
out what's wrong for now.

Also, result_mausezahn_test1.txt says:
| Station that generates the traffic with mausezahn is connected to eth2, statistics on eth1

Could you take the statistics on the ingress switch port please? (eth2)

As for result_mausezahn_test2.txt, it says:
| Station that generates the traffic with mausezahn is connected to eth2, statistics on br0

but eth2 is not one of the ports under br0! (only eth1 and veth1 are)
So you don't expect eth2 to forward these packets, do you?

Also, the same comment: please capture the statistics at the ingress
port, not at the expected egress port. I am operating under the
assumption that in the case which doesn't work for you, the switch drops
the packets somewhere, and I want to find out the reason (which should
be on the ingress port).
