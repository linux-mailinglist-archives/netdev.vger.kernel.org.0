Subject: [wpan-next v2 00/27] IEEE 802.15.4 scan support

Hello,

Here is a series attempting to bring support for scans in the
IEEE 802.15.4 stack. A second series follows in order to align the
tooling with these changes, bringing support for a number of new
features such as:

* Sending (or stopping) beacons. Intervals ranging from 0 to 14 are
  valid for passively sending beacons at regular intervals. An interval
  of 15 would request the core to answer to received BEACON_REQ.
  # iwpan dev wpan0 beacons send interval 2 # send BEACON at a fixed rate
  # iwpan dev wpan0 beacons send interval 15 # answer BEACON_REQ only
  # iwpan dev wpan0 beacons stop # apply to both cases

* Scanning all the channels or only a subset:
  # iwpan dev wpan1 scan type passive duration 3 # will not trigger BEACON_REQ
  # iwpan dev wpan1 scan type active duration 3 # will trigger BEACON_REQ

* If a beacon is received during a scan, the internal PAN list is
  updated and can be dumped, flushed and configured with:
  # iwpan dev wpan1 pans dump
  PAN 0xffff (on wpan1)
      coordinator 0x2efefdd4cdbf9330
      page 0
      channel 13
      superframe spec. 0xcf22
      LQI 0
      seen 7156ms ago
  # iwpan dev wpan1 pans flush
  # iwpan dev wpan1 set max_pan_entries 100
  # iwpan dev wpan1 set pans_expiration 3600

* It is also possible to monitor the events with:
  # iwpan event

* As well as triggering a non blocking scan:
  # iwpan dev wpan1 scan trigger type passive duration 3
  # iwpan dev wpan1 scan done
  # iwpan dev wpan1 scan abort

The PAN list gets automatically updated by dropping the expired PANs
each time the user requests access to the list.

Internally, both requests (scan/beacons) are handled periodically by
delayed workqueues when relevant.

So far the only technical point that is missing in this series is the
possibility to grab a reference over the module driving the net device
in order to prevent module unloading during a scan or when the beacons
work is ongoing.

Finally, this series is a deep reshuffle of David Girault's original
work, hence the fact that he is almost systematically credited, either
by being the only author when I created the patches based on his changes
with almost no modification, or with a Co-developped-by tag whenever the
final code base is significantly different than his first proposal while
still being greatly inspired from it.

Cheers,
Miqu√®l

Changes in v2:
* Create two new netlink commands to set the maximum number of PANs that
  can be listed as well as their expiration time (in seconds).
* Added a patch to the series to avoid ignoring bad frames in hwsim as
  requested by Alexander.
* Changed the symbol duration type to receive nanoseconds instead of
  microseconds.
* Dropped most of the hwsim patches and reworked how drivers advertise
  their channels in order to be capable of deriving the symbol durations
  automatically.
* The scanning boolean gets turned into an atomic.
* The ca8210 driver does not support scanning, implement the driver
  hooks to reflect the situation.
* Reworked a bit the content of each patch to ease the introduction of
  active scans. 
* Added active scan support.
