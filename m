Swap in port/bond terminology where appropriate, leaving all legacy sysfs
and procfs interface mentions in place, but marked as deprecated.
Additionally, add more netlink/iproute2 documentation, and note that this
is the preferred method of interfacing with the bonding driver. While
we're at it, also make some mention of NetworkManager's existence.

+Major terminology rework done late 2020, to start to remove the use of
+the socially problematic terms "master" and "slave" from the code. The
+"master" device is now referred to as simply the "bond" device and the
+"slave" devices as "ports", but all sysfs, procfs and module options
+have been retained as-is for userspace compatibility. The sysfs and
+procfs interfaces are deprecated though, in favor of userspace making
+use of netlink and iproute for any and all bonding configuration and
+information-gathering work.
