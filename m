I didn't mind the core split itself but some things just logically seemed 
to clearly belong to the other side of the split (or to a later patch 
altogether). As the split was made mostly based on files rather than on 
logical level, it is no surprise some defs end up into wrong side of it.
That being said, then there's IMHO no need to go entirely overboard with 
this and fine-comb every single line in the header files.

And yes, I know the compile cannot fail until 03. However, the other 
aspect is that when somebody, a few years from now, has to look to 
these changes from the git history, having most of the elements in
logical places will help.
