Tom, 
Happy new year!!

I believe that these patches cost you great effort. However, we would like to see the 6-10 subsequent patch set to be really able to understand where are you going with these ones.

At some point you mentioned that router vendors make protocol in miserable way. Do you believe the right way is that every individual defines the protocol the way he wants in a single authored IETF draft ? 

Regarding 10) Support IPv4 extension headers.
I see that your drafts describing the idea are expired [1][2]. 
Do you plan to add to the kernel the implementation of expired contents ? or did you abandoned these drafts and described the idea somewhere else that Iâ€™m not aware of ?

[2] https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-herbert-ipv4-eh-01
