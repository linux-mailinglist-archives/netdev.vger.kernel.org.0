[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggestions
to make it better, or if you want it re-generated with the latest status.]

Of the currently open syzbot reports against the upstream kernel, I've manually
marked 99 of them as possibly being bugs in the net subsystem.  This category
only includes the networking bugs that I couldn't assign to a more specific
component (bpf, xfrm, bluetooth, tls, tipc, sctp, wireless, etc.).  I've listed
these reports below, sorted by an algorithm that tries to list first the reports
most likely to be still valid, important, and actionable.

Of these 99 bugs, 17 were seen in mainline in the last week.

Of these 99 bugs, 4 were bisected to commits from the following people:

	Florian Westphal <fw@strlen.de>
	Ilya Maximets <i.maximets@samsung.com>
	Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>
	David Ahern <dsahern@gmail.com>

If you believe a bug is no longer valid, please close the syzbot report by
sending a '#syz fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the
original thread, as explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug to the net subsystem, please let me know,
and if possible forward the report to the correct people or mailing list.

Here are the bugs:

For some reason the original report email for this bug is missing from the LKML
archive at lore.kernel.org, so my script couldn't check whether anyone has
replied to it or not.  The Google Groups link above should still work, though. 
Also try searching for the bug title.

For some reason the original report email for this bug is missing from the LKML
