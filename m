Good day,
Please my name is Tofis Emmanuel.
I am the son to late Tofis Aron
My father was a businessman doing business with white government people
coming to buy gold  and cotton from Burkina Faso  and I came back from a
friend=E2=80=99s house one day and met my father and mother dead with my yo=
unger
brother.
They were shot dead by an unknown person and out of fear that the killer
also wanted me dead, I ran away to a nearby country where I have been
hiding  for 11 years and I came back now to Burkina Faso and saw that my
father's business friends had sold my father's house.
I got to my father's house and met a new occupant that said the house was
sold to them by my father=E2=80=99s business friends and I am scared becaus=
e of the
fear that the killer of my parent could be my father business friends and
they will still want me dead if they are responsible for my parent=E2=80=99=
s death.
I have gone into hidden because of the fear and I went to check my father
account with his bank to know what my father left in his account and the
bank just revealed to me that my father made a transfer of 8 million
dollars from a bank to their bank in my name into an account he opened
newly in my name before his death and the money has been abandoned in their
bank since my father died.
It is a big shock to me and I want to move this money from Burkina Faso
immediately to a foreign country where I can run to and live there please.
I need an urgent person, a God fearing person I can trust to help me
receive this money and after receiving the money I will come over to the
person=E2=80=99s country.
Can I trust you please, please be sincere to me.
I am very scared and I don=E2=80=99t want what happened to my parents to ha=
ppen to
me.
If I hear from you and you are a good person, I will connect you to the
bank immediately to make the transfer quickly.
Please reply to me quickly when you receive my message please.
Tofis Emmanuel
