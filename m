I consider that it is needed because bpf_xdp_adjust_head() just a common helper function,
veth as one driver application should keep the same as 32 bytes of headroom as other driver.
And convert_to_xdp_frame set() also store info in top of packet, and set:
	xdp_frame = xdp->data_hard_start;

I guess you mean that previous subtraction is not necessary ? this line : void *head = hard_start - sizeof(struct xdp_frame); ?
But in the veth_xdp_rcv_one,below line will use head pointer,
case XDP_TX:
                        orig_frame = *frame;
                        xdp.data_hard_start = head;
