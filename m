NT Interrupt counter Entropy : A counter theory : RS

"more importantly, our
distribution is not 2-monotone like NT's, because in addition to the
cycle counter, we also include in those 4 words a register value, a
return address, and an inverted jiffies. (Whether capturing anything
beyond the cycle counter in the interrupt handler is even adding much of
value is a question for a different time.)"

NT Interrupt counter Entropy : A counter theory : RS

To be clear interrupts are old fashioned (NT & Bios) : Points

Network cards have offloading? Yes & why cannot we?

Offloaded does not mean that a time differential matrix HASH AES of 32Bit w=
ords,
Cross pollinated though MMX, AVX , SiMD is plausible!

Combined with even network latency timing & interrupt latency...

Various system differentials can alternate line in our table per clock sync=
!

In this reference Quartz clock instability is not only counter acted by NTP=
...
But also utilized as a variable co-modifier.

So why not also advantage ourselves of the clock frequency scaling
effect to confuse odds again for Entropy (Random, Not Entropy)

SSD does also have a write counter & a cleared state, not so boring as
one thinks if per 32KB segment is hashed in 4Bit, 8,Bit 32Bit float!
(remember we have DOT3 DOT 4 & INT8 in ML)

We can utilize write cycle statistics & all hardware; Interrupts by
themselves are rather Boring!

Computed timings on processes multiplexed over 3 Threads per group in
competition is also a potential complexifier of Random

PreSEED Poly Elliptic SiMD RAND : RS

Preseed ; 3 Seeds with AES or Poly ChaCha or even 1 : 2 would be
rather fast Init

Blending them would make a rather paranoid Kernel developer feel safe! :D

Like so List:

3 seeds 32Bit or 64Bit :
Examples :

1 Seed : Pre seeded from CPU IRQ & Net 16Bit values each & merged
2 & 3 from server https://pollinate.n-helix.com &or System TRNG

4 Seed mix 128Bit Value

Advantages :

AVX & SiMD Mixxer is fast 'Byte Swap & Maths etcetera" & MultiThreaded
AES Support is common :

*

"Taking spinlocks from IRQ context is problematic for PREEMPT_RT. That
is, in part, why we take trylocks instead. But apparently this still
trips up various lock dependency analysers. That seems like a bug in the
analyser's that should be fixed, rather than having to change things
here.

But maybe there's another reason to change things up: by deferring the
crng pre-init loading to the worker, we can use the cryptographic hash
function rather than xor, which is perhaps a meaningful difference when
considering this data has only been through the relatively weak
fast_mix() function.

The biggest downside of this approach is that the pre-init loading is
now deferred until later, which means things that need random numbers
after interrupts are enabled, but before work-queues are running -- or
before this particular worker manages to run -- are going to get into
trouble. Hopefully in the real world, this window is rather small,
especially since this code won't run until 64 interrupts have occurred."

Rotation Alignment : "The advantage of choosing such =E2=80=9Caligned=E2=80=
=9D
rotation counts is that aligned rotation counts are much faster than
unaligned rotation counts on many non-64-bit architectures."

http://cr.yp.to/siphash/siphash-20120918.pdf

https://www.aumasson.jp/siphash/siphash.pdf

"Choice of rotation counts. Finding really bad rotation counts for ARX
algorithms turns out to be difficult. For example, randomly setting
all rotations in
BLAKE-512 or Skein to a value in {8, 16, 24, . . . , 56} may allow known at=
tacks
to reach slightly more rounds, but no dramatic improvement is expected.
The advantage of choosing such =E2=80=9Caligned=E2=80=9D rotation counts is=
 that
aligned rotation counts are much faster than unaligned rotation counts
on many non-64-bit
architectures. Many 8-bit microcontrollers have only 1-bit shifts of bytes,=
 so
rotation by (e.g.) 3 bits is particularly expensive; implementing a rotatio=
n by
a mere permutation of bytes greatly speeds up ARX algorithms. Even 64-bit
systems can benefit from alignment, when a sequence of shift-shift-xor can =
be
replaced by SSSE3=E2=80=99s pshufb byte-shuffling instruction. For comparis=
on,
implementing BLAKE-256=E2=80=99s 16- and 8-bit rotations with pshufb led to=
 a
20% speedup
on Intel=E2=80=99s Nehalem microarchitecture."

As we see rotation may benefit from the addition of Quartz crystal
alignment sync data from 4 cycles & aligning data blocks,

Obviously we can pre share 4 64Bit blocks use; use a pre seed AES/ChaCha Qu=
ad!
Indeed we can have 16 64Bit pre Seeds & chose them by time sync for kernel
