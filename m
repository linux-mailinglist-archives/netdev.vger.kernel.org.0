Ok, will follow the pattern if it is really necessary.

I will talk about the optimization later.

According to my defination in this patchset:
frag page: page alloced from page_pool_alloc_frag() with page->pp_frag_count
           being greater than one.
non-frag page:page alloced return from both page_pool_alloc_frag() and
              page_pool_alloc_pages() with page->pp_frag_count being one.

I assume the above 'non-page pool pages' refer to what I call as 'non-frag
page' alloced return from both page_pool_alloc_frag(), right? And it is
still about doing the (size << 1 > max_size)' checking at the begin instead
of at the middle right now to avoid extra steps for 'non-frag page' case?

This is the optimization I was taking about: suppose we start
from a clean state with 64K page size, if page_pool_alloc_frag()
is called with size being 2K and then 34K, we only need one page
to satisfy caller's need as we do the '*offset + size > max_size'
checking before the '(size << 1 > max_size)' checking.

As you mentioned below, it is at the cost of evicting the previously
fragmented page, I thought about keeping it when implementing, but I
am not sure evicting it is really matter if the previously fragmented
page does not pass the testing by '*offset + size > max_size'?

Or maybe we should adjust the code a litte bit as below to allow the
optimization I mentioned without the cost of evicting the previously
fragmented page?

struct page *page_pool_alloc_frag(struct page_pool *pool,
                                  unsigned int *offset,
                                  unsigned int size, gfp_t gfp)
{
        unsigned int max_size = PAGE_SIZE << pool->p.order;
        struct page *page = pool->frag_page;

        if (unlikely(size > max_size))
                return NULL;

        if (PAGE_POOL_DMA_USE_PP_FRAG_COUNT)
                goto alloc_non_frag;

        size = ALIGN(size, dma_get_cache_alignment());

        if (page && pool->frag_offset <= max_size) {
                *offset = pool->frag_offset;
                pool->frag_users++;
                pool->frag_offset += size;
                alloc_stat_inc(pool, fast);
                return page;
        }

        if (unlikely((size << 1) > max_size))
                goto alloc_non_frag;

        if (page) {
                page = page_pool_drain_frag(pool, page);
                if (page) {
                        alloc_stat_inc(pool, fast);
                        goto frag_reset;
                }
        }

        page = page_pool_alloc_pages(pool, gfp);
        if (unlikely(!page))
                return NULL;

        pool->frag_page = page;
frag_reset:
        pool->frag_users = 1;
        *offset = 0;
        pool->frag_offset = size;
        page_pool_fragment_page(page, BIAS_MAX);
        return page;

alloc_non_frag:
        *offset = 0;
        return page_pool_alloc_pages(pool, gfp);
}

Do you mean 'mono-frag' as the unifying of frag and non-frag
page handling by assuming all pages in page pool having one
frag user initially in patch 1?
If yes, please let's continue the discussion in pacth 1 so that
we don't have to restart the discussion again.

Or is there some other obvious concern about 'mono-frag' I missed?

It seems you still have some concern about the unifying in patch 1,
please do go and comment why it is not ok to assume 'frag count == 1'
as non-frag page in patch 1.

As explained as above.
