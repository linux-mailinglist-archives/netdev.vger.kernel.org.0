I think xmas break has mostly wiped my memory from 2020 ;) so it would be
good to describe the sketched out design for how this will look like inside
the cover letter in terms of planned uapi exposure. (Additionally discussing
api design proposal could also be sth for BPF office hour to move things
quicker + posting a summary to the list for transparency of course .. just
a thought.)

Glancing over the series, while you've addressed the bpf_xdp_adjust_tail()
helper API, this series will be breaking one assumption of programs at least
for the mvneta driver from one kernel to another if you then use the multi
buff mode, and that is basically bpf_xdp_event_output() API: the assumption
is that you can do full packet capture by passing in the xdp buff len that
is data_end - data ptr. We use it this way for sampling & others might as well
(e.g. xdpcap). But bpf_xdp_copy() would only copy the first buffer today which
would break the full pkt visibility assumption. Just walking the frags if
xdp->mb bit is set would still need some sort of struct xdp_md exposure so
the prog can figure out the actual full size..

Also in terms of logistics (I think mentioned earlier already), for the series to
be merged - as with other networking features spanning core + driver (example
af_xdp) - we also need a second driver (ideally mlx5, i40e or ice) implementing
this and ideally be submitted together in the same series for review. For that
it probably also makes sense to more cleanly split out the core pieces from the
driver ones. Either way, how is progress on that side coming along?

Thanks,
Daniel
