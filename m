Dear Friend......

We bring greetings to you in the name of the lord. This message is
sent to you as a notification that you have been chosen to benefit
from our charity project aimed at touching lives and helping those
that we came across the world as God has blessed us. I won the
Powerball lottery of $ 150 Million on November 2, 2019 and I have
voluntarily decided to donate the sum of $ 75 Million to charity, I try
to reach people randomly from different sources and modes so as to
touch lives from different angles, Hence you are getting a message
here.

You have been listed as one of the lucky recipients to receive $ 8.5
Million dollars
This donation is made out to you so to enable you strengthen your
personal issues and mostly to generously help us extend hands of
giving to the less privileged, orphans and charity organizations
within your locality To verify

Get back to me on how to receive the donation through our official
email address below ( mrschantal11@gmail.com )

you receive your donation

Thanks

Mrs.Bill.Chantal Lawrence
