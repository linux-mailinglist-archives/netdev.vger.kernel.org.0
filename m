Well, I am not familiar with DAHDI at all.
I didn't even know about the DAHDI project.
The project seems to use specific kernel driver and I would like to avoid
these external drivers.

If the pef2256 PHY provides a configure function, who is going to call this
configure(). I mean the one calling the configure will be the configuration
owner. None of the MFD child can own the configuration as this configuration
will impact other children. So the MFD (top level node) owns the configuration.

Thanks for pointing this interface.
It is specific to ethtool but I can see the idea.
The 'get_status' I proposed could be extended later to provide more
information related to the colour of the alarm if needed.
ethtool and related interfaces are very well fitted with Ethernet and
related PHYs. I am not sure that ethtool will be usable for the pef2256.

I translated to another notifier to keep the core (MFD) pef2256 API
independent.

But indeed this could be changed.
If changed, the MFD pef2256 will have to handle the full struct
phy_status_basic as the translation will not be there anymore.
Right now, this structure is pretty simple and contains only the link state
flag. But in the future, this PHY structure can move to something more
complex and I am not sure that filling this struct is the MFD pef2256
responsibility. The PHY pef2256 is responsible for the correct structure
contents not sure that this should be moved to the MFD part.

Each of them should have their own notifier if they can notify.
At least they will need their own notifier at they PHY driver level.
Having or not a translation from something else would depend on each device
PHY driver implementation.
Also, maybe some PHY will not be able to provide notifications but only
the get_status(). In this case, the notifier is not needed.
The proposed QMC HDLC driver handles this case switching to polling mode
if the PHY is not able to provide notification.

I agree.
I would like this first implementation without too much API restriction
in order to see how it goes.
The actual proposal imposes nothing on the PHY internal implementation.
the pef2256 implementation chooses to have two notifiers (one at MFD
level and one at PHY level) but it was not imposed by the API.
