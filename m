Hello,

I need to inform you that I have given up on pushing this series 
upstream. This work might be continued by Yonatan Linik 
<ylinik@drivenets.com> who works for the same employer (I will stop 
working there).

The main reason for abandoning this is that engaging in zero-sum 
competition in upstream is the last thing I ever want to do.

Bye,
Leonard
