Hello;


Our agency has in possession a parcel shipped from a government agency
of the United Kingdom. During transport the package was damaged and
the label became almost illegible. What we have deciphered appears to
be your name.

In events such as this we have no choice but to turn these packages
over to the closest match on the shipping address. This is required by
law. And this is why we are contacting you.


These packages have been scanned and x-rayed in hopes to find any
information to surrender them to the rightful owner.


We discovered, while x-raying these packages, that they contain a
large amount of United States currency. We assume this was a
transaction or transfer to you and that you are probably still
expecting the delivery. (The total estimated sum is close to $8M)


Again, we are required by law to turn this package over to the
rightful owner and since your name appears on the shipping label, that
owner is probably you.


We would like you to forward this parcel to you but we need to verify
your full name, proper shipping address and a telephone number so we
may begin processing this claim.


There is a limited time required by law to claim
lost/damaged/illegible packages. Once this time expires we must turn
the package over to the United States Government who disperses the
contents to charities. Any unclaimed money is sent to the US Treasury
Office where it is destroyed.


If you feel that you should claim this money please reply with the
information above and we can release it to you.


CONTACT.... mrdavidmorris90@gmail.com


Thank you for your help in this matter;


MR DAVID MORRIS
