Not sure about that, I've seen "host" used as antonym of "SoC", so
 if the device is configured with the SoC as the admin this could
 confuse people.
I think whatever term we settle on, this document might need to
 have a 'Definitions' section to make it clear :S

Instead of "the PCIe controller" I should probably say "the local PCIe
 controller", since that's the wording the devlink-port doc uses.

Quite possibly.  Current EF100 NICs can't do nested switching either.

Right, I should probably make it more clear that this isn't the only
 way it could be done.
I'm merely trying to make clear that things that don't look like
 netdevices might still have a v-port and hence need a repr.

Would adding the word "hardware" before "TX queue" help?  Have to
 admit the netdev-queue interpretation hadn't occurred to me.

Yes, and that should work fine per se.  It's just not reflected in the
 phys_port_name string in any way, so legacy userland that relies on
 that won't have that piece of info (but it never did) and probably
 assumes that c0 is local.
