I'm toying with a patch similar to your 3/3 (most relevant difference
being the lack of a limit to the batch size), on top of ixgbe (which
sends all the pkts to the GRO engine), and I'm observing more
controversial results (UDP only):

* when a single rx queue is running, I see a just-above-noise
peformance delta
* when multiple rx queues are running, I observe measurable regressions
(note: I use small pkts, still well under line rate even with multiple
rx queues)

I'll try to test your patch in the following days.

Side note: I think that in patch 3/3, it's necessary to add a call to
gro_normal_list() also inside napi_busy_loop().

Cheers,

Paolo
