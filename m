It feels a bit 'unconstrained' to me as well.  As Jakub said you added
some documentation, but the direction of this long-term is not clear.
What seems to happen too often is that we skip creating better infra for
existing devices and create it only for the newest shiniest object.
These changes are what garners the most attention from those who grant
permission to push things upstream (*cough* managers *cough*), but it's
not the right choice in this case.  I'm not sure if that is part of what
bothers Jakub, but it is one thing that bothers me and why this feels
incomplete.

The thing that has been bouncing around in my head about this (and until
I was in front of a good text-based MUA I didn't dare respond) is that
we seem to have an overlap in functionality between what you are
proposing and existing virtual device configuration, but you are
completely ignoring improving upon the existing creation methods.
Whether dealing with a SmartNIC (which I used to describe a NIC with
general purpose processors that could be running Linux and I think you
do, too) or a regular NIC it seems like we should use devlink to create
and configure a variety of devices these could be:

1.  Number of PFs (there are cases where more than 1 PF per uplink port
    is required for command/control of the SmartNIC or where a single
    PCI b/d/f may have many uplink ports that need to be addressed
    separately)
2.  Device-specific SR-IOV VFs visible to server
3.  mdev devices that _may_ have representers on the embedded cores of
    the NIC
4.  Hardware VirtIO-net devices supported
5.  Other non-network devices (storage given as the first example) 
6.  ...

We cannot get rid of the methods for creating hardware VFs via sysfs,
but now that we are seeing lots of different flavors of devices that
might be created we should start by making sure at a minimum we can
create existing hardware devices (VFs) with this devlink interface and
move from there.  Is there a plan to use this interface to create
subdevs that are VFs or just new subdev flavors?  I could start to get
behind an interface like this if the patches showed that devlink would
be the one place where device creation and control could be done for all
types of subdevs, but that isn't clear that it is your direction based
on the patches.

So just to make sure this is clear, what I'm proposing that devlink is
used to create and configure all types of devices that it may be
possible to create, configure, or address from a PF and the starting
place should be standard, hardware VFs.  If that can be done right and
we can address some of the issues with the current implementation (more
than one hw addr is a _great_ example) then adding new flavours for the
server devices and and adding new flavors for SmartNIC-based devices
should be easy and feel natural.
