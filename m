Sabrina Dubroca <sd@queasysnail.net>

We are seeking talks of 40 minutes in length (including Q & A),
optionally accompanied by papers of 2 to 10 pages in length.  The
papers, while not required, are very strongly encouraged by the

Any kind of advanced networking and/or bpf related topic will be
considered.
