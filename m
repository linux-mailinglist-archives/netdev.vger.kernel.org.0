It was the first thing I said to Lorenzo when he first reported the
problem to me (over chat): It is likely packets sitting in a TCP queue.
Then I instructed him to look at output from netstat to see queues and
look for TIME-WAIT, FIN-WAIT etc.

This is *not* what I'm asking for.

With TCP sockets (pipes etc) we can take care of closing the sockets
(and programs etc) to free up the SKBs (and perhaps wait for timeouts)
to make sure the page_pool shutdown doesn't hang.

The problem arise for all the selftests that uses veth and bpf_test_run
(using bpf_test_run_xdp_live / xdp_test_run_setup).  For the selftests
we obviously take care of closing sockets and removing veth interfaces
again.  Problem: The defer_list corner-case isn't under our control.

It is not a memory usage concern.

I really like the sd->defer_list system and I think is should be enabled
by default.  Even if disabled by default, we still need to handle these
corner cases, as the selftests shouldn't start to cause-issues when this
gets enabled.

The simple solution is: (1) When netdevice/NAPI unregister happens call
defer_list flushing helper.  And perhaps we also need to call it in
xdp_test_run_teardown().  How do you feel about that?
