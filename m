Yes, I aware of these users and what and why they asked it.

They didn't ask us to have new config for every feature/file, but to have
light ethernet device.

Other users are distributions and they enable all options that supported in
the specific kernel they picked, because they don't know in advance where their
distro will be used.

You also don't have capacity to test various combinations, so you
test only small subset of common ones that are pretty standard. This is why
you have this feeling of "work quite well".

And I'm not talking about compilations but actual regression runs.

I suggest to reduce number of configs to small amount, something like 3-5 options:
 * Basic ethernet driver
 * + ETH
 * + RDMA
 * + VDPA
 * ....
 * Full mlx5 driver

And there is nothing wrong with simple grep, it was my copy/paste from
another internal thread where this config bloat caused us to some griefs
in regression.

Thanks
