I think it's important to explain why we call these helpers
before/after transmissions. I've reworded the beginning of the sentence
to: "Tranceivers usually have..." to reflect that this is the current
state of the support, but is not marble solid either. I've also updated
the second sentence about the core "Hence, the core currently only
handles..."

That's true, and this is addressed in a later series where we actually
stop exporting these helpers because we want everything to be handled
by the _xmit_complete/error() helpers and keep full control of the
queue. The comments added above will remain because they are useful to
understand why these helpers are called. But the last sentence above
their use from drivers being preferred to the netif_ calls will be
dropped.
