I checked 3 variants, they do same things: epoll_ctl() races against
epoll_wait(), and this is exactly the bug reproduction, regardless
actual read() from a file descriptor or EPOLLET flag set.

I adapted the logic from epollbug.c and included it into 
epoll_wakeup_test.c
test suite, you should have received the email: "[PATCH 3/3] kselftest:
introduce new epoll test case".  Please, take a look or ask your 
colleague
to take a look. If no objections - then fine, leave as is.

Thanks.
