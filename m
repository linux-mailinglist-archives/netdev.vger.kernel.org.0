I think there's also the option (for your particular case) to conservatively
mark the entire range a dynptr pointing to stack represents as STACK_MISC
whenever a *write* happens (through bpf_dynptr_write or pointers obtained using
bpf_dynptr_data). We do know exact memory start and length when creating the
dynptr, right?

If somebody tries to be funky, e.g. by doing a spill and then trying to
overwrite its value, the entire range becomes STACK_MISC, so reload would just
mark the reg as unknown. You can be a bit smarter when you know the exact start
and length of stack memory e.g. bpf_dynptr_data pointer points to, but I'm
unsure that will be needed.

Otherwise things work as normal, users can spill stuff to the stack if they
wants, and as long as they are not writing through the dynptr again, we don't
remark the entire range STACK_MISC. If that was the last use of dynptr and it
went out of scope, things work normally. If not, the dynptr and its buffer
should still be in scope so it won't be the compiler doing something funny
spilling stuff into it, only the user.

Due to STACK_INVALID complications over-eager remarking as STACK_MISC might only
make sense for privileged programs, but otherwise I think this is ok.

Am I missing something important?
