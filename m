I think we should really not look at FOLL_GET here. Just check for 
FOLL_PIN (as said, even FOLL_LONGTERM would be sufficient, but I 
understand the reasoning to keep it, although I would drop it :P ). It 
also better matches your comment regarding pinning ...

See the comment in is_valid_gup_args() regarding "LONGTERM can only be 
specified when pinning". (well, there we also check that FOLL_PIN has to 
be set ... ;) )

... should that be "!vma_needs_dirty_tracking(vma)" ?

If the fs needs dirty tracking, it should be disallowed.

Maybe that explains why it's still working for Matthew in his s390x 
test. ... or I am too tired and messed up :)
