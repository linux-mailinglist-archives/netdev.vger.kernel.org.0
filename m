Probably more inlined, yea. A simpler version of your patch would
probably be something like this, right?

However, from looking at kernel/sched/isolation.c a bit, I noticed that
indeed you're right that most of these functions (save one) are based on
cpu_possible_mask rather than cpu_online_mask. This is frustrating
because the code makes smart use of static branches to remain quick, but
ANDing housekeeping_cpumask() with cpu_online_mask would, in the fast
path, wind up ANDing cpu_online_mask with cpu_possible_mask, which is
silly and pointless. That makes me suspect that maybe the best approach
would be adding a relevant helper to kernel/sched/isolation.c, so that
the helper can then do the `if (static_branch_unlikely(&housekeeping_overridden))`
stuff internally.

Or maybe you'll do some measurements and decide that just [ab]using
housekeeping_test_cpu() like above is actually optimal? Not really sure
myself.

Anyway, I'll keep an eye out for your joint wireguard/padata series. Be
sure to CC the people who wrote the isolation & housekeeping code, as
they likely have opinions about this stuff (and certainly know more than
me about it).

Jason
