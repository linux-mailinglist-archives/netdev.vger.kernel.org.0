Hi Abhishek,

it gets multitudes more complicated if you look at HCI User Channel and other pieces that utilize the core HCI infrastructure.

HCI interface lost, because of USB disconnect is different. That is a clean path. Similar to RFKILL that just only does a power down.

I wonder if sending a HCI Reset at before entering suspend would be enough. Meaning clear all controller states first and then suspend. This will still disable any kind of remote wakeup support, but might avoid having to fully power down and power up again.

>> Since what you are proposing is a pretty heavy change that might has side affects. For example the state machine for the mgmt interface has no concept of a power down/up from the kernel. It is all triggered by bluetoothd.

We really need a conformance hci-tester that checks if a controller is behaving correctly as promised.
