Attention: Beneficiary,

This is to bring to your notice that because of the impossibility of
your fund transfer through our western union network, we

have credited your total fund of $15,500,000.00 into an ATM VISA
card,and we have paid the delivery fee of your ATM VISA card

for you, we paid it because your ATM VISA card worth of $15,500,000.00
which we have registered for deliver, has less than 16

days to expire in the custody of the UPS Company and when it expires,
the money will go into federal government treasury

account.

For that we decided to help you pay off the money so that your ATM
VISA card will not expire, because we trust that when you

receive this your ATM VISA card, definitely you must pay us back and
even compensate us for helping you. Like we stated

earlier, the delivery charges has been paid ,therefore the only money
you were advice to send to them is their official

security keeping fees of $25usd every day.

Like I stated earlier, the crediting re-activation, delivery and the
company registration charges has been paid by me, but I

did not pay their official security keeping fees since they refused,
they refused and the reason is that they do not know

when you are going to contact them and the demurrage might have
increased by then, They told me that their official  security

keeping fees is $$25.00 per a day , and I deposited it yesterday by
10:am in the morning to their office.

Therefore you should contact them with the below contact information;


Contact person name: (Victor nelson)
Email; filefileo532@gmail.com
Logistic Manager: Mr Fransisco F,


Try to contact them today and also send them the official security
keeping charge to avoid increasing of their fee and let me

know once you receive this your ATM VISA CARD.

Contact them today with your full information requested below;

Try to indicate all this codes to them because it will prove that you
