Hi David,

I get your point but I'm not sure that it is the correct interpretation
that should be applied in this particular case for the following
reasons:

- In "4.5.2 Address claim requirements" it is explicitly stated that
"The CF shall claim its own address when initializing and when
responding to a command to change its NAME or address" and this seems to
completely ignore the "4.4.4.3 Address violation" that states that the
address-claimed message shall be sent also when "the CF receives a
message, other than the address-claimed message, which uses the CF's own
SA".
Please note that the address was already claimed by the CF, so I think
that the initialization requirements should not apply in this case since
all disputes were already resolved.

- If the offending CF ignores the dispute, as you said, then the other
CF has no chance to ever resume normal operation and so the network
cannot be aware that the other CF is not working correctly because the
offending CF is spoofing its own address. This seems to make useless the
requirement that states to activate the DTC in "4.4.4.3 Address
violation".

Regards,
Devid
