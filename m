I agree. I find it likely that other implementation also would disallow
to bind on such addresses. I'll see if I can find out more this week.

That's what I was also wondering. But inet_addr_type() is not only
referenced 8 times inside the kernel, but also exported. So ultimately
the reason for returning RTN_BROADCAST is irrelevant as it's here to
stay. That's probably why the original code was "correcting" its
semantics on the fly by explicitly checking for 0.0.0.0 and remarketing
it as RTN_LOCAL.

As for ipv4_is_zeronet() vs ipv4_addr_any(), I do agree ipv4_addr_any()
is more consistent with other stuff and a better name by itself.

Again, inet_addr_type() is exported...

I think this is already significantly better than checking for 0.0.0.0
separately and changing chk_addr_ret depending on that. I also feel that
a comment, in this case, might go a long way. And all the
nonlocal-is-allowed-or-address-is-local logic could go in one line.
Maybe along the lines of:

/* never accept multicast and broadcast addresses */
if (!ipv4_addr_any() &&
    (chk_addr_ret != RTN_LOCAL && !inet_can_nonlocal_bind(...)) ||
    chk_addr_ret == RTN_MULTICAST || chk_addr_ret == RTN_BROADCAST))
                         return -EADDRNOTAVAIL;

This, to me, is loads more readable than the pre-5.17 code.
