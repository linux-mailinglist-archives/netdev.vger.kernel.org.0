Version 3 is wrong here, it should be version 4. Please fix everywhere 
else too.

Why do you quote "object"?

Let's use object (e.g. for filesystem/inode) or data (e.g. for TCP port).

TCP4/TCP6 would not make sense for users, please be explicit, and in 
this case "TCP" is enough.

BTW, IP4 and IP6 don't exist, they should be replaced *everywhere* with 
IPv4 and IPv6.

This is not correct.

This part should be for the fourth version.

Please add similar standalone code + explanation sections for network here.

Users don't know what is a hook. Such kernel internals are not required 
to explain things.

I don't think this section is needed. There is a lot of missing access 
types for now and it is not useful to list them all. The "Current 
limitations" section lists limitations about the currently implemented 
access types (e.g. filesystem, TCP).

Try to avoid talking about syscall directly but highlight actions 
instead. Using Landlock doesn't create "secure connections", 
unfortunately. ;)

Might be better:
To be able to explicitly allow TCP operations (e.g., adding a network 
rule with `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_TCP_BIND`), the kernel must support TCP 
(`CONFIG_INET=y`). Otherwise, sys_landlock_add_rule() returns an 
`EAFNOSUPPORT` error, which can safely be ignored because this kind of 
TCP operation is already not possible.


> For TCP6 family sockets `CONFIG_IPV6=y` must be switched on.

This is not required because if IPv6 is not supported there is nothing 
to do for IPv6 sockets.
