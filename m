Yes, I know it would make sense. It's also not possible without
introducing regressions (the bridge currently being able to receive
unknown multicast without IFF_ALLMULTI sounds like a big roadblock).
It also introduces questions about whether user space and upper
interfaces need to be aware that the termination plane is not the only
thing they need to configure.

Actually, you said it yourself that IFF_PROMISC creates a second copy of
a forwarded known unicast packet, on which it calls br_pass_frame_up().
Think of dev_uc_add() as the IFF_PROMISC behavior applied to a single
unicast MAC DA, as opposed to all MAC DAs. You can't add a local FDB
entry *and* be consistent with bridge IFF_PROMISC behavior.

Happy coincidence, because IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP will eventually call
ip_mc_filter_add() -> dev_mc_add() and this will update the RX filter of
the bridge. And the multicast snooping code will update the forwarding
plane. I wonder if there's something similar to take away from this
w.r.t. unicast behavior. Like for example the bridge driver could do
dynamic address learning for locally originated traffic, and the
forwarding and termination planes would be once again in sync with no
need for higher layers to know about the distinction anyway. At least
for a while, until the entry ages out.

I think letting individual DSA sub-drivers decide how generous they'd
like to be with a promiscuous bridge is pure insanity. Today a
promiscuous bridge wants to see all traffic being mirrored, and we don't
do that. That is an inconvenient truth we need to accept and have a
common position on. Supposedly a position driven centrally by the bridge
driver itself.

Yeah, I don't think so. Doing nothing at all is way better than
entangling the RX filtering logic even more with the forwarding logic,
IMHO.
