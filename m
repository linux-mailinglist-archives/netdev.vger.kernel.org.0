Hi,

I just want to use this little opportunity to inform you about my
success towards the transfer. I'm currently out of the country for an
investment with part of my share, after completing the transfer with
an Indian business man. But i will visit your country, next year.
After the completion of my project. Please, contact my secretary to
send you the (ATM) card which I've already credited with the sum of
($500,000.00). Just contact her to help you in receiving the (ATM)
card. I've explained everything to her before my trip. This is what I
can do for you because, you couldn't help in the transfer, but for the
fact that you're the person whom I've contacted initially, for the
transfer. I decided to give this ($500,000.00) as a compensation for
being contacted initially for the transfer. I always try to make the
difference, in dealing with people any time I come in contact with
them. I'm also trying to show that I'm quite a different person from
others whose may have a different purpose within them. I believe that
you will render some help to me when I, will visit your country, for
another investment there. So contact my secretary for the card, Her
contact are as follows,

Full name: Mrs, Jovita Dumuije,
Country: Burkina Faso
Email: jovitadumuije@gmail.com

Thanks, and hope for a good corporation with you in future.

Godwin Peter,
