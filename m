Hello,

   My name is Liam Williams, i am a business consultant,analyst and deal 
maker. I'm based in Canada. I have a business proposal for you.

My client is looking for a profitable business/investment project 
outside the GCC to invest their fund privately.

I have contacted you to see if you would be interested in this 
offer/deal, a sizable compensation is offered to you as project manager 
if we come to terms and if you can help close this deal.

More information is available once I read from you.


regards
