Subject: [PATCH v3 0/6] Add TDX Guest Support (Attestation support)

Hi All,

Intel's Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) protect guest VMs from malicious
hosts and some physical attacks. VM guest with TDX support is called
as TD Guest.

In TD Guest, the attestationÂ process is used to verify the 
trustworthiness of TD guest to the 3rd party servers. Such attestation
process is required by 3rd party servers before sending sensitive
information to TD guests. One usage example is to get encryption keys
from the key server for mounting the encrypted rootfs or secondary drive.
    
Following patches adds the attestation support to TDX guest which
includes attestation user interface driver, user agent example, and
related hypercall support.

In this series, only following patches are in arch/x86 and are
intended for x86 maintainers review.

* x86/tdx: Add TDREPORT TDX Module call support
* x86/tdx: Add GetQuote TDX hypercall support
* x86/tdx: Add SetupEventNotifyInterrupt TDX hypercall support

Patch titled "platform/x86: intel_tdx_attest: Add TDX Guest attestation
interface driver" adds the attestation driver support. This is supposed
to be reviewed by platform-x86 maintainers.

Also, patch titled "tools/tdx: Add a sample attestation user app" adds
a testing app for attestation feature which needs review from
bpf@vger.kernel.org.

This series is the continuation of the following TDX patch series which
added basic TDX guest support.

[set 1] - https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/project/lkml/list/?series=508773
[set 2] - https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/project/lkml/list/?series=508792
[set 3] - https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/project/lkml/list/?series=508794
[set 4] - https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/project/lkml/list/?series=508795
[set 5] - https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/project/lkml/list/?series=508798

Also please note that this series alone is not necessarily fully
functional.

Changes since v2:
 * Rebased on top of v5.14-rc1.
 * Rest of the history is included in individual patches.

Changes since v1:
 * Included platform-x86 and test tool maintainers in recipient list.
 * Fixed commit log and comments in attestation driver as per Han's comments.
