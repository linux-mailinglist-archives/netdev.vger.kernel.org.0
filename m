 1. What is 6pack, and what are the advantages to KISS?
+======================================================
 
 6pack is a transmission protocol for data exchange between the PC and
 the TNC over a serial line. It can be used as an alternative to KISS.
 
 6pack has two major advantages:
+
 - The PC is given full control over the radio
   channel. Special control data is exchanged between the PC and the TNC so
   that the PC knows at any time if the TNC is receiving data, if a TNC
   buffer underrun or overrun has occurred, if the PTT is
   set and so on. This control data is processed at a higher priority than
   normal data, so a data stream can be interrupted at any time to issue an
-  important event. This helps to improve the channel access and timing 
-  algorithms as everything is computed in the PC. It would even be possible
