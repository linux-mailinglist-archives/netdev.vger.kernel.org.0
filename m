The ISDN documentation is a mix of admin guide, uAPI and kAPI.

Ideally, it should be split. Yet, not sure if it would worth
the troble. Anyway, we have the same kind of mix on several
drivers specific documentation. So, just like the others, keep
the directory at the root Documentation/ tree, just adding a
pointer to it at the kAPI section, as the documentation was
written with the Kernel developers in mind.

 3.2. Telling the driver to provide more information
-     ----------------------------------------------
+---------------------------------------------------
      Building the driver with the "Gigaset debugging" kernel configuration
      option (CONFIG_GIGASET_DEBUG) gives it the ability to produce additional
      information useful for debugging.
 
      You can control the amount of debugging information the driver produces by
-     writing an appropriate value to /sys/module/gigaset/parameters/debug, e.g.
-        echo 0 > /sys/module/gigaset/parameters/debug
+     writing an appropriate value to /sys/module/gigaset/parameters/debug,
+     e.g.::
+
+	echo 0 > /sys/module/gigaset/parameters/debug
+
      switches off debugging output completely,
-        echo 0x302020 > /sys/module/gigaset/parameters/debug
+
+     ::
+
+	echo 0x302020 > /sys/module/gigaset/parameters/debug
+
      enables a reasonable set of debugging output messages. These values are
      bit patterns where every bit controls a certain type of debugging output.
      See the constants DEBUG_* in the source file gigaset.h for details.
 
      The initial value can be set using the debug parameter when loading the
-     module "gigaset", e.g. by adding a line
-        options gigaset debug=0
+     module "gigaset", e.g. by adding a line::
+
+	options gigaset debug=0
+
      to your module configuration file, eg. /etc/modprobe.d/gigaset.conf
 
      Generated debugging information can be found
-     - as output of the command
-         dmesg
+     - as output of the command::
