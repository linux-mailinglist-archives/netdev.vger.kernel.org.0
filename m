Can you retry without 9p/9pnet loaded and see if they are loaded by the mount
process?
The same autoloading functionality exists for filesystems using
request_module("fs-%s") in fs/filesystems.c
If that also doesn't work it would indicate an issue with the kernel setup in general.

What is the value of CONFIG_MODPROBE_PATH?
And the contents of /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe?

Sure.
