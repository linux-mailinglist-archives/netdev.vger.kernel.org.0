Hello and Greetings my dear,
How are you today? With hope you are found in good condition of
health, together with your beloved family? My Dear, this is the second
time I am sending the same message to you, because I have an urgent
and very important request that made me contact you in this regard. I
am a widow diagnosed with brain tumor disease. It has gotten to a very
bad stage which my doctors have confirmed and announced to me that I
have just a few days to leave, Now that I=E2=80=99m ending the race like th=
is,
without any family members and no child.

I'm a business woman from Indonesia dealing with gold exportation here
in Africa. I made a substantial deposit with the bank which I have
decided to hand over and entrust the sum of ($ 9,650,000.00, Nine
Million Six Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars) in my account to you
for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileged ones in
your country to fulfill my final wish on earth. But before handing
over my data=E2=80=99s to you, I want you to understand that It will be my
pleasure to compensate you as my Investment Manager/Partner with 50%
percent of the total money for your effort in handling the
transaction, while 50% of the fund will be invested into the charity
project there in your country. Meanwhile if only you are interested I
am waiting for your prompt response Now I have access to the Internet
in the hospital, I will give you further details and my data. Please
always check your e-mail as I have only a few days to leave on this
earth. Your early response will be appreciated.

Kind Regards.
Sincerely Mrs. Marina Bagni.
