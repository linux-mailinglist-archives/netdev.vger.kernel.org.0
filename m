FROM MR.Adama Usman
AUDIT& ACCOUNT MANAGER
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO
WEST AFRICA.

Dear Friend,

With due respect, I have decided to contact you on a
business transaction that will be beneficial for both of us. At the
bank last account and auditing evaluation, my staffs came across to
an old account which was being maintained by a foreign client who we
learn was among the deceased passengers of motor accident on
November.2003,the deceased was unable to run this account since his
death. The account has remained dormant without the knowledge of
his family since it was put in a safe deposit account in the bank for
future investment by the client.Since his death, even the members of
his family haven't applied for claims over this fund and it has been
in the safe deposit account until I discovered that it cannot be
claimed since our client is a foreign national and we are sure that he
has no next of kin here to take claims over the money.
As the director of the department, this discovery was brought to my
office for me to decide on what  to do .I decided to seek for an
option through which to transfer this money out of the bank and out of
the country too.The total amount in the account is 18.6 million USD
with my positions as A staffs of the bank, I am handicapped because I
cannot operate foreign accounts and cannot lay strong claim over this
money. The client was a foreign national and you will only be asked to
act as his next of kin and I will supply you with all the necessary
information and bank data to assist you in being able to transfer this
money to any bank of your choice where this money could be transferred
into. The total sum will be shared as follows: 50% for me, 50% for you
and
expenses incidental occur during the transfer will be incur by both of
us. The transfer is risk free on both sides hence you are going to
follow my instruction till the fund being transfer to your account.
Since I work in this bank. that is why you should be confident in the
success of this transaction, because you will be updated with
information as at when desired. I will wish you to keep this
transaction secret and confidential as I am hoping to retire with my
share of this money at the end of transaction which will be. when this
money is safe in your account. I will then come over to your country
for sharing according to the previously agreed percentages. You might
even have to advise me on possibilities of investment in your country
or elsewhere of our choice. May God help you to help me to a restive
retirement, Amen ,And You have to contact me through my private e-mail
at(adamausman47@gmail.com )Please for further information and inquires
feel free to contact me back immediately for more explanation and
better understanding I want you to assure me your capability of
handling this project with trust by providing me your following
information details such as:

(1)NAME..............
(2)AGE:................
(3)SEX:.....................
(4)PHONE NUMBER:.................
(5)OCCUPATION:.....................
(6)YOUR COUNTRY:.....................

Yours sincerely,
MR.Adama Usman
