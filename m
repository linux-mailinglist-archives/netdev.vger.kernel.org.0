It sounds like you want to add a runtime check to the fast-path to
handle these corner cases?

For performance reason we should not call page_pool_inflight() check in 
fast-path, please!

Details: You hopefully mean running/calling page_pool_release(pool) and 
not page_pool_destroy().

I'm not totally against the idea, as long as someone is willing to do
extensive benchmarking that it doesn't affect fast-path performance.
Given we already read pool->p.flags in fast-path, it might be possible
to hide the extra branch (in the CPU pipeline).

Sure, we can remove the print statement, but it feels like closing our
eyes and ignoring the problem.  We can remove the print statement, and
still debug the problem, as I have added tracepoints (to debug this).
But users will not report these issue early... on the other hand most of
these reports will likely be false-positives.

This reminds me that Jakub's recent defer patches returning pages
'directly' to the page_pool alloc-cache, will actually result in this
kind of bug.  This is because page_pool_destroy() assumes that pages
cannot be returned to alloc-cache, as driver will have "disconnected" RX
side.  We need to address this bug separately.  Lorenzo you didn't
happen to use a kernel with Jakub's patches included, do you?
