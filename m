Those hooks are not coming at the end of the IP processing. There is
very relevant IP code after those hooks that cannot be bypassed such
as fragmentation, tunneling and neighbour output. Such transformation
needs to happen after the IP processing, exactly from where Lukas is
proposing.

Look: ip6tables, arptables and ebtables are a copy and paste from the
original iptables.

At that time, the only way one way to add support for ingress/egress
classification in netfilter: add "devtables", yet another copy and
past from iptables, that was a no-go.

This is not a problem anymore since there is a consolidated netfilter
framework to achieve ingress/egress classification.

I remember one of your collegues used this same argument against new
hooks back in 2015 [0], and the introduction of this hook was proven
to be negligible. This patchset introduces code that looks very much
the same.

I can make a list of recent updates to the output path, several of
them very are targeted to very specific usecases. You did not care at
all about performance impact of those at all, however, you care about
netfilter for some unknown reason.

In my opinion, your original feedback has been addressed, it's time to
move on.

Thank you.
