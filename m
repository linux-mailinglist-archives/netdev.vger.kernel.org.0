Thanks. I just ensured that it worked, by doing:

getsockopt(fd, SOL_IP, IPT_SO_GET_INFO, &info, &optlen);

and accepting IPT_SO_GET_INFO in main.c.

What would make it more generic? I made the API message format-
independent. It has the capability of starting the user space process
as required, when there is a communication.

True, it is not generic in the sense that it can accomodate any
possible use case. The main goal is to move something that was running
in the kernel to user space, with the same isolation guarantees as if
the code was executed in the kernel.

UMD is better in the sense that it establishes a bidirectional pipe
between the kernel and the user space process. With that, there is no
need to further restrict the access to a sysfs file, for example.

The UMD mechanism is much more effective: the pipe is already
established with the right process, whose code was integrity-checked
because embedded in the kernel module.

In addition to that, I'm using seccomp to further restrict what the
user space process can do (read, write, exit, ...). That process cannot
open new communication channels, even if corrupted. It is expected to
send to the kernel simple data structures, that the kernel can
effectively sanitize.

The last step to achieve full isolation would be to deny ptrace/kill on
the user space process created by the UMD management library so that,
in lockdown mode, not even root can interfer with that process.
