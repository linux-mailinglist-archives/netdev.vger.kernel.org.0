yes, packet can be push up to IP stack to handle the nat through bridge device.Â 


In my case dnat 2.2.1.7 to 10.0.0.7, It assume the mac address of the two address

is the same known by outer. So The bridge can just do nat( without modify mac address or oif).

But in This case modify the packet dmac to bridge device, the packet push up through bridge device

Then do nat and route send back to bridge device.
