IMHO I would vote for this approach too.

There are many users of that open source IP CAN core right now and the 
out-of-tree maintenance is no fun for all of them.

When the driver status is fine from the technical and programming style 
standpoint we should move the improvements for the lockless 
transmissions to a later date.

Oliver
