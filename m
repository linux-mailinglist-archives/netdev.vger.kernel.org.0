[CCing the wifi-driver and the net developers, as a "JFYI" to ensure
they are aware of this "newer kernel requires newer firmware"
regression, so they can jump in if they want]

Well, until now I didn't see any other report about a problem like this.
Maybe things work better for others with that hardware â€“ in that case it
might be something not worth making a fuzz about. But I'll wait another
week or two before I remove this from the tracking.
