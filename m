While I agree in principle (I have suggested to make MAC timestamping
the default before), I see a problem with the recent LAN8814 PHY
timestamping support, which will likely be released with 6.3. That
would now switch the timestamping to PHY timestamping for our board
(arch/arm/boot/dts/lan966x-kontron-kswitch-d10-mmt-8g.dts). I could
argue that is a regression for our board iff NETWORK_PHY_TIMESTAMPING
is enabled. Honestly, I don't know how to proceed here and haven't
tried to replicate the regression due to limited time. Assuming,
that I can show it is a regression, what would be the solution then,
reverting the commit? Horatiu, any ideas?

I digress from the original problem a bit. But if there would be such
a whitelist, I'd propose that it won't contain the lan8814 driver.

Other than that, I guess I have to put some time into testing
before it's too late.
