Is this really how the taprio should behave? I mean, should the frame
really be dropped by taprio if TXTIME is outside of the window? Why
would taprio bother with TXTIME at all?

If both are offloaded, are the h/w queues reordered if there is a
new frame with an earlier TXTIME? Or will the queue be blocked by a
frame with a later transmission time?

TBH I've never understood why the ETF qdisc will drop frames with
TXTIME in the past. I mean it makes sense with hardware offloading. But
without it, how can you make sure the kernel will wake up the queue
at just the right time to be able to send it. You can juggle the delta
parameter but on you don't want to send to too early, but on the other
hand the frame will likely be dropped if delta is too small. What am
I misssing here?
