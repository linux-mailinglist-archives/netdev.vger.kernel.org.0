This is for hibernation is for pvhvm/hvm/pv-on-hvm guests as you may call it.
The method is just there to check if "xen suspend" is in progress.
I do not see "xen_suspend" differentiating between pv or hvm
domain until later in the code hence, I abstracted it to xen_is_xen_suspend.

The mode was left there in case its needed for restore prepare cases. But you
are right the only thing I currently care about whether shutting_down ==
SHUTDOWN_SUSPEND. Infact, the notifier may not be needed in first place.
xen_is_xen_suspend could work right off the bat using 'shutting_down' variable
itself. *I think so* I will test it on my end and send an updated patch.

It would be great to support that however, its  out of
scope for this patch set.
Iâ€™ll be happy to discuss it separately.

That's another good use case to make it work with however, I still
think that should be tested/worked upon separately as the feature itself
(PVH Dom0) is very new.
