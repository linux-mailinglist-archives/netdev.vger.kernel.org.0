Hello!

I think same applies also for 1000BASE-PX or 10GBASE-PR GEPON passive
ethernet networks (Beware GPON != GEPON).

But I think this is not an issue. There are also other "shared medium"
technologies (e.g. mobile network; or WiFi on DFS channels) for which
exists hardware supported by mainline kernel (3G/LTE modems).

Yes, I just described it as "application" layer. It is complicated and
basically something which is not suppose to be implemented in kernel.
Plus GPON vendors extends (standardized) OMCI protocol with their own
extension which means that without their implementation on client side
it is impossible to fully establish connection to "server" OLT part.

Interesting... Do you know where to buy or test such passive GPON SFP sticks?

And is there some documentation how these sticks works? And what kind of
phy mode they are using over SerDes? Because due to different inbound
and outbound speeds it cannot be neither 1000base-x nor 2500base-x.

Yea... But maybe it could be easier to implement just "client part"
(ONU/ONT) without "server part" (OLT).

Well... If you think that it is possible to address these issues
directly to GPON vendors and they will fix them in next version of GPON
SFP sticks, I could try to find some time and prepare list of lot of
issues...
