Thanks for pointing out the latest patches. Good to know that you are 
still working on this.

No worries, and thanks for the work!

Good idea, but I'm not really in a hurry. Now knowing that work on the 
trigger offloading is still active, I guess I will just wait a bit until 
the dust has settled and maybe the bindings have been defined. Then I 
can try to implement this in the PHY driver.

Thanks
