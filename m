Hello My Dearest.

 I AM MRS. NITAYA  P. WALTER, NATIONALITY OF THAILAND AND USA, I WAS
ONCE MARRIED TO LATE WALTER RICHARD IN THE  CITY OF NEIGHBORHOOD IN
CLEVELAND, (OHIO)  IN USA WHO  WAS A CRUDE OIL BUSINESS MAN THAT DIED
OF HEART ATTACK FEW YEARS AGO, WITHOUT A CHILD.

SINCE HIS DEATH I DECIDED NOT TO REMARRY, WHEN MY LATE HUSBAND WAS
ALIVE HE DEPOSITED THE SUM OF US$ 25 MILLION (TWENTY-FIVE MILLION
DOLLARS) IN HSBC BANK IN MILAN CITY OF ITALY IN EUROPEAN CONTINET.

PRESENTLY THIS MONEY IS STILL IN HSBC BANK SLEEPING. MY LATE HUSBAND
WALTER RICHARD MADE THIS MONEY AVAILABLE FOR EXPORTATION OF CRUDE OIL
IN MALAYSIA BEFORE HIS DEATH CAME.

 RECENTLY, MY DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT HE CANNOT GUARANTEE ME OF LONG
LIVING  DUE TO MY THROAT CANCER DISEASE, HAVING KNOWN MY CONDITION SO
I DECIDED TO HAND YOU OVER THIS MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF THE
LESS-PRIVILEGED, WIDOWS AND THE NEEDY  PEOPLE  AS I HAVE ALREADY WILL
SOME OF THE PROPERTIES AND FUNDS HERE IN USA TO ST. THOMAS MORE NEWMAN
CENTER, YOU WILL UTILIZE THIS MONEY THE WAY I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT
HEREIN. I WANT YOU TO TAKE 30 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL MONEY FOR YOUR
PERSONAL USE WHILE 70% OF THE MONEY WILL GO TO  CHARITY=E2=80=9D PEOPLE AND
HELPING THE ORPHANAGES AS LISTED ABOVE.

 I DON=E2=80=99T WANT MY HUSBAND=E2=80=99S EFFORTS TO BE USED BY THE GOVERN=
MENT OF
ITALY, I GREW UP AS AN ORPHAN AND I DON=E2=80=99T HAVE ANYBODY AS A FAMILY
MEMBER, JUST TO ENDEAVOUR THAT THE NAME OF GOD IS MAINTAINED. AM DOING
THIS SO THAT GOD WILL FORGIVE MY SINS AND ACCEPT MY SOUL BECAUSE THIS
SICKNESS HAS SUFFERED ME SO MUCH.

AS SOON AS I RECEIVE YOUR POSITIVE REPLY I SHALL GIVE YOU THE CONTACT
OF MY LATE HUSBAND ACCOUNTANT AT HSBC BANK IN MILAN ITALY TO GIVE YOU
A GOOD DIRECTION ON HOW TO CLAIM THIS FUND,  I WILL SEND AUTHORITY
LETTER THAT WILL PROVE YOU THE PRESENT BENEFICIARY OF THE MONEY IN THE
 BANK THAT IS IF YOU ASSURE ME THAT YOU WILL ACT ACCORDINGLY AS I
STATED HEREIN. HOPING  TO RECEIVE YOUR REPLY.

 REGARDS,

MRS. NITAYA  P. WALTER
