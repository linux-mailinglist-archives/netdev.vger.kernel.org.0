ACPI r6.5, sec 6.3.7, about _STA says:

  - Bit [0] - Set if the device is present.
  - Bit [1] - Set if the device is enabled and decoding its resources.
  - Bit [3] - Set if the device is functioning properly (cleared if
    device failed its diagnostics).

  ...

  If a device is present on an enumerable bus, then _STA must not
  return 0. In that case, bit[0] must be set and if the status of the
  device can be determined through a bus-specific enumeration and
  discovery mechanism, it must be reflected by the values of bit[1]
  and bit[3], even though the OSPM is not required to take them into
  account.

Since PCI *is* an enumerable bus, I don't think we can use _STA to
decide whether a PCI device is present.

We can use _STA to decide whether a host bridge is present, of course,
but that doesn't help here because the host bridge in question is
PNP0A08:00 that leads to [bus 00-3d], and it is present.

I don't know exactly what path led to the igb issue, but I don't think
we need to figure that out.  I think we just need to avoid the use of
_STA in fwnode_device_is_available().

6fffbc7ae137 ("PCI: Honor firmware's device disabled status") appeared
in v6.3-rc1, so I think we need to revert or fix it before v6.3, which
will probably be tagged Sunday (and I'll be on vacation
Friday-Monday).
