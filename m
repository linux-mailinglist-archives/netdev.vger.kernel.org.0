Thanks for the encouraging words ;)

Basically yes. Just that it wouldn't be an oops any longer, r8169
would detect the missing dedicated PHY driver and bail out in probe().

Right. Even though kmod treats a softdep more or less like a harddep
with regard to module loading, it's called "soft" for a reason.
Relying on a softdep to satisfy a hard dependency doesn't seem
to be the ideal solution.
