I know about two use cases:

* ppp unit id is used for generating network interface name. So if you
  want interface name ppp10 then you request for unit id 10. It is
  somehow common that when ppp interface has prefix "ppp" in its name
  then it is followed by unit id. Seems that existing ppp applications
  which use "ppp<num>" naming expects this. But of course you do not
  have to use this convention and rename interfaces as you want.

* Some of ppp ioctls use unit id. So you may want to use some specific
  number for some network interface. So e.g. unit id 1 will be always
  for /dev/ttyUSB1.

Yes, this could be really useful as currently if you ask netlink to
create a new ppp interface you have to use ioctl to retrieve this unit
id. But ppp currently does not provide netlink dump operation.

Also it could be useful for this "bug":
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20210807132703.26303-1-pali@kernel.org/t/#u

And with unit id there also another issue:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20210807160050.17687-1-pali@kernel.org/t/#u

But due to how it is used we probably have to deal with it how ppp unit
id are defined and assigned...
