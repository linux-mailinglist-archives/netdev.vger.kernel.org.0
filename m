why would you redirect then touch the packet afterwards ? 
if you have a bad program, then it is a user issue.

Another solution is to have an exception function defined in the
BPF_prog, this function by itself is another program that can be
executed to notify the prog about any exception/err that happened after
the main BPF_program exited and let the XDP program react by its own
logic.

example:

BPF_prog:
    int XDP_main_prog(xdp_buff) {
        xdp_adjust_head/tail(xdp_buff);
        return xdp_redirect(ifindex, flags);
    }

    int XDP_exception(xdp_buff, excption_code) {
        if (excetption_code == XDP_REDIRECRT_MTU_EXCEEDED) {
                ICMP_response(xdp_buff);
                return XDP_TX;
        }
        return XDP_DROP;
    }


netdev_driver_xdp_handle():
   act = bpf_prog_run_xdp(prog, xdp); // Run XDP_main_prog
   if (act == XDP_REDIRECT)
       err = xdp_do_redirect(netdev, xdp, prog);
       if (err) { 
          // Run XDP_exception() function in the user prog
          // finds the exception handler of active program
          act = bpf_prog_run_xdp_exciption(prog, xdp, err);
          // then handle exception action in the driver
(XDP_TX/DROP/FORWARD).. 
       }

of-course a user program will be notified only on the first err .. 
if it fails on the 2nd time .. just drop..
