Hello,

My name is Steve Dibenedetto.
I apologize to have contacted you this way without a direct relationship. There is an opportunity to collaborate with me in the sourcing of some materials needed by our company for production of the different medicines we are researching.

I'm aware that this might be totally outside your professional specialization, but it will be a great source for generating extra revenue. I  discovered a manufacturer who can supply us at a lower rate than our company's previous purchases.
I will give you more specific details when/if I receive feedback from you showing interest.

Warm Regards  
Steve Dibenedetto
Production & Control Manager,
Green Field Laboratories
Gothic House, Barker Gate,
Nottingham, NG1 1JU,
United Kingdom.
