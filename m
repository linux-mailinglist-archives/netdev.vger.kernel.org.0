This series contains a variety of cold and hot savoury changes to Intel
drivers.  Some of the fixes could be considered for stable even though
the author did not request it.

Hulk Robert cleans up (i.e. removes) a function that has no caller for
the iavf driver.

Radoslaw fixes an issue when there is no link in the VM after the
hypervisor is restored from a low-power state due to the driver not
properly restoring features in the device that had been disabled during
the suspension for ixgbevf.

Kai-Heng Feng modified e1000e to use mod_delayed_work() to help resolve
a hot plug speed detection issue by adding a deterministic 1 second
delay before running watchdog task after an interrupt.

Sasha moves functions around to avoid forward declarations, since the
forward declarations are not necessary for these static functions in
igc.  Also added a check for igc during driver probe to validate the NVM
checksum.  Cleaned up code defines that were not being used in the igc
driver.  Adds support for IP generic transmit checksum offload in the
igc driver.

Updated the iavf kernel documentation by a developer with no life.

Jake provides another fm10k update to a local variable for ease of code
readability.

Mitch fixes the iavf driver to allow the VF to override the MAC address
set by the host, if the VF is in "trusted" mode.

Mauro S. M. Rodrigues provides several changes for i40e driver, first
with resolving hw_dbg usage and referencing a i40e_hw attribute.  Also
implemented a debug macro using pr_debug, since the use of netdev_dbg
could cause a NULL pointer dereference during probe.  Finally cleaned up
code that is no longer used or needed.

Firo Yang provides a change in the ixgbe driver to ensure we sync the
first fragment unconditionally to help resolve an issue seen in the XEN
environment when the upper network stack could receive an incomplete
network packet.

Mariusz adds a missing device to the i40e PCI table in the driver.

v2: Mauro S. M. Rodrigues updated patches 10 & 11 of the series based on
    feedback from Jakub Kicinski.  Also updated patch 13 description so
    that the "Fixes:" tag was no wrapped.

The following are changes since commit 6703a605b5ab33502d7a327de880188013d7c377:
  Merge branch 'net-tls-small-TX-offload-optimizations'
