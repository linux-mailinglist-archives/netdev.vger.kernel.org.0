hm, fscache code shouldn't be used for cache=mmap, I'm surprised you can
hit this...

... but I did encouter these on cache=loose/fscache, although I hadn't
noticed any bad behaviour such as invalid file descriptors.

> Any clues?

Since I hadn't noticed real harm I didn't look too hard into it, I have
a couple of ideas:
- the cookie is just a truncated part of the inode number, it's possible
we get real collisions because there are no guarantees there won't be
identical inodes there.
In particular, it's trivial to reproduce by exporting submounts:

## on host in export directory
# mount -t tmpfs tmpfs m1
# mount -t tmpfs tmpfs m2
# echo foo > m1/a
# echo bar > m2/a
# ls -li m1 m2
m1:
total 4
2 -rw-r--r-- 1 asmadeus users 4 Mar 26 22:23 a

m2:
total 4
2 -rw-r--r-- 1 asmadeus users 4 Mar 26 22:23 a

## on client
# /mnt/t/m*/a
foo
bar
FS-Cache: Duplicate cookie detected
FS-Cache: O-cookie c=0000099a [fl=4000 na=0 nA=0 s=-]
FS-Cache: O-cookie V=00000006 [9p,tmp,]
FS-Cache: O-key=[8] '0200000000000000'
FS-Cache: N-cookie c=0000099b [fl=0 na=0 nA=0 s=-]
FS-Cache: N-cookie V=00000006 [9p,tmp,]
FS-Cache: N-key=[8] '0200000000000000'


But as you can see despite the warning the content is properly
different, and writing also works, so this probably isn't it... Although
the fscache code we're using is totally different -- your dmesg output
is from the "pre-netfs" code, so that might have gotten fixed as a side
effect?


- lifecycle diff√©rence between inode and fscache entry.
David pushed a patch a few years back to address this but it looks like
it never got merged:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/155231584487.2992.17466330160329385162.stgit@warthog.procyon.org.uk/

the rationale is that we could evict the inode then reallocate it, and
it'd generate a new fscache entry with the same key before the previous
fscache entry had been freed.
I'm not sure if that got fixed otherwise and it might not be possible
anymore, I didn't follow that, but given 


 - some other bug...

If you have some kind of reproducer of invalid filedescriptor or similar
errors I'd be happy to dig a bit more, I don't particularly like all
aspect of our cache model but it's not good if it corrupts things.
