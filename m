Dear,

I got your contact through the internet due to serious searching for a
reliable personality.
I am Mmamie Shimirah from Free Town Capital of Sierra Leone. Time of
opposed to the government of President Ahmad Tejan Kebbah the
ex-leader.

Since 21st November, 2005 But I am current residing in Calavi Benin
Republic due to war of my country, my mother killed on 04/01/2002 for
Sierra Leone civilian war my father decided to change another
residence country with me because I am only child for my family bad
news that my father passed away on 25/11/2018. During the war, My
father made a lot of money through the illegal sales of Diamonds. To
the tune of $10,200,000.

This money is currently and secretly kept in ECOWAS security company
here in Porto-Novo Benin , but because of the political turmoil which
still exists here in Africa, I can not invest the money by myself,
hence am soliciting your help to help me take these funds into your
custody and also advise me on how to invest it.

And I want to add here that if agreed 35% of the total worth of the
fund will be yours minus your total expenses incurred during the
clearing of the fund in
Porto Novo that if agreed 35% that's $3,570,000 I would like to invest
on heavy duty agricultural equipment and earth moving machines to
enable me go into a full scale mechanized farming.

While l wait to hear from you soon, my warm regards to you and your family.
