Dear Friend,

I decided to contact you after a careful thought that you may be
capable of handling this business transaction which I explained below,
I am the head of Accounts and Audit Department of Bank of Africa
Ouagadougou. In my department while cross-checking the files of
foreigners. since our federal government has announced on the need of
settling all foreign bills to enable foreign investors to come into
our country and as an order from African unity governed by African
heads, I discovered an abandoned sum of $15.5m US dollars (fifteen
million, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account that belongs
to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family
in a plane crash.

Since i got information about his death, The bank have been expecting
his next of kin to come over and claim his money because The fund
cannot be released unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or
relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but
unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin(his son and wife)
died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for
the claim .It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to
make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the
next of kin (I want to present you as his business associate )to the
deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming
for it and I don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as
unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money
remained Unclaimed after Nine years, the money will be transferred
into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.. The request of foreigner as
next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the
customer was a foreigner and a Burkina be cannot stand as next of kin
to a foreigner.

I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 60% would be for me .
There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to
the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer
of this fund to your account as arranged, you must apply first to the
bank as next of kin of the deceased customer.

Upon receipt of your reply, more details and text of application form
will be given to you for immediate transfer of the fund, I will not
fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and
that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required
arrangements have been made for the transfer.

i will like  you to send me this information about you such as  your
full names, direct telephone numbers, and physical address.

Your quick response will be highly appreciated.

Yours sincerely,

Mr. Hamzak Wadrago.
