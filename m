I doubt that it's an issue with the PCIe bridge (itself at least). The
same type of bridge is used for both dGPU and NVME SSD on my device (see
lspci output below) and those work fine. Also if I'm seeing that right
it's from the Intel CPU, so my guess is that a lot more people would
have issues with that then.

I don't know about the hardware side, so it might be possible that it's
an issue with integrating both bridge and wifi chip, in which case it's
still probably best handled via DMI quirks unless we know more.

Also as Tsuchiya mentioned in his original submission, on Windows the
device is reset via this D3cold method. I've only skimmed that
errata.inf file mentioned, but I think this is what he's referring to:

   Controls whether ACPIDeviceEnableD3ColdOnSurpriseRemoval rule will be
   evaluated or not on a given platform. Currently
   ACPIDeviceEnableD3ColdOnSurpriseRemoval rule only needs to be
   evaluated on Surface platforms which contain the Marvell WiFi
   controller which depends on device going through D3Cold as part of
   surprise-removal.

and

   Starting with Windows releases *after* Blue, ACPI will not put
   surprise-removed devices into D3Cold automatically. Some known
   scenarios (viz. WiFi reset/recovery) rely on the device cycling
   through D3Cold on surprise-removal. This hack allows surprise-removed
   devices to be put into D3Cold (if supported by the stack).

So, as far as I can tell, the chip doesn't like to be surprise-removed
(which seems to happen during reset) and then needs to be power-cycled,
which I think is likely due to some issue with firmware state.

So the quirk on Windows seems very Surface specific.

There also seem a bunch of revisions of these chips around, for example
my SB2 is affected by a bug that we've tied to the specific hardware
revision which causes some issues with host-sleep (IIRC chip switches
rapidly between wake and sleep states without any external influence,
which is not how it should behave and how it does behave on a later
hardware revision).

 From my Surface Book 2 (with the same issue):

  - lspci -tvnn: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/mm3YpcZJ8N/
  - lspci -vv -nn: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/dctTDP738N/
