OK so the runtime part comes from plugging in various SFP modules into a
cage but other than that, for a "fixed" link such as a SFF or a soldered
down PHY, do we agree that there would be no runtime changing of the
'phy-mode'?

What I am trying to understand is why this needs to be added to the
Device Tree as opposed to a bitmask within the PHY driver that indicates
the various interface mode capabilities which, looking at the code you
shared below, is how you make decisions ultimately.

You would traditionally find the words "line side" (copper, optical,
etc.) and "MAC side" being used in datasheets, maybe you can use a
similar naming here?
