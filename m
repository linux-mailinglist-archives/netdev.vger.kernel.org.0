Yes, this is much better than just adding __maybe_unused :).

To be on the safe side (and to get rid of a & in tx.c:666), the "3 - 
idx" should be something like "return (3 - idx) & 
CARL9170_TX_STATUS_QUEUE". I think its also possible to just use clamp_t
(or min_t since the u8 has no negative values) or make use of a switch 
statement [analogues what was done in ath10k commit: 91493e8e10 "ath10k: 
fix recent bandwidth conversion bug" (just to be clear. Yes this ath10k 
commit has nothing to do with queues, but it is a nice, atomic 
switch-case static inline function example).]

Seems to be "sort of". I compiled both, the current vanilla carl9170 and
with Lee Jones' patch on Debian's current gcc 10.2.0 (Debian 10.2.0-5)
and gnu ld 2.35.

The ar9170_qmap symbol is only present in the object file if ar9170_qmap 
is used by the source. In the final module file (carl9170.ko), there are 
two ar9170_qmap symboles in the module's .rodata section (one is coming 
from main.o code and the other from tx.o).

(The use of __maybe_unused didn't make any difference. Same overall 
section and file sizes).

Cheers,
Christian
