I've also been trying to get the mv88e6xxx PCS conversion in, but
it's been held up because there's a fundamental problem in DSA that
this series is addressing.

This series is addressing a faux pas on my part, where I had forgotten
that phylink doesn't get used in DSA unless firmware specifies a
fixed-link (or a PHY) - in other words when the firmware lacks a
description of the link.

So, what do we do...

FTTP is here! 40Mbps down 10Mbps up. Decent connectivity at last!
