Hi,

after 4 RFC versions I am now sending these patches for real.

The code applies on net-next.

Changes since RFC v4:
- added device-tree binding documentation 
- the OF code now checks for linux,default-hw-mode property so that
  default HW mode can be set in device tree (like linux,default-trigger)
  (this was suggested by Andrew)
- the OF code also checks for enable-active-high and led-open-drain
  properties, and the marvell PHY driver now understands uses these
  settings when initializing the LEDs
- the LED operations were moved to their own struct phy_device_led_ops
- a new member was added into struct phy_device: phyindex. This is an
  incrementing integer, new for each registered phy_device. This is used
  for a simple naming scheme for the devicename part of a LED, as was
  suggested in a discussion by Andrew and Pavel. A PHY controlled LED
  now has a name in form:
    phy%i:color:function
  When a PHY is attached to a netdevice, userspace can control available
  PHY controlled LEDs via /sys/class/net/<ifname>/phydev/leds/
- legacy LED configuration in Marvell PHY driver (in function
  marvell_config_led) now writes only to registers which do not
  correspond to any registered LED

Changes since RFC v3:
- addressed some of Andrew's suggestions
- phy_hw_led_mode.c renamed to phy_led.c
- the DT reading code is now also generic, moved to phy_led.c and called
  from phy_probe
- the function registering the phydev-hw-mode trigger is now called from
  phy_device.c function phy_init before registering genphy drivers
- PHY LED functionality now depends on CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGERS

Changes since RFC v2:
- to share code with other drivers which may want to also offer PHY HW
  control of LEDs some of the code was refactored and now resides in
  phy_hw_led_mode.c. This code is compiled in when config option
  LED_TRIGGER_PHY_HW is enabled. Drivers wanting to offer PHY HW control
  of LEDs should depend on this option.
- the "hw-control" trigger is renamed to "phydev-hw-mode" and is
  registered by the code in phy_hw_led_mode.c
- the "hw_control" sysfs file is renamed to "hw_mode"
- struct phy_driver is extended by three methods to support PHY HW LED
  control
- I renamed the various HW control modes offeret by Marvell PHYs to
  conform to other Linux mode names, for example the "1000/100/10/else"
  mode was renamed to "1Gbps/100Mbps/10Mbps", or "recv/else" was renamed
  to "rx" (this is the name of the mode in netdev trigger).
