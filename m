I guess that this callback is called when Bridge receive some kind of
fatal error. Non-AER-aware bridges probably do not have to inform system
that error happened and kernel would not call this callback. So I guess
it depends on to which "machine" you need this network adapter.

So in my opinion this callback is there for PCI subsystem to inform
driver that error happened and let driver to do any hw specific recovery
if it is possible.

But I think problem described here can be slightly different. It is
needed to check if device is still alive or was disconnected.
