Hello Jakub, hello David,

this is a pull request of 22 patches for net-next/master.

The first patch is by me, for the mailmap file and maps the email
address of two former ESD employees to a newly created role account.

The next 3 patches are by Oleksij Rempel and add support for GPIO
based switchable CAN bus termination.

The next 3 patches are by Vincent Mailhol. The first one changes the
CAN netlink interface to not bail out if the user switched off
unsupported features. The next one adds Vincent as the maintainer of
the etas_es58x driver and the last one cleans up the documentation of
struct es58x_fd_tx_conf_msg.

The next patch is by me, for the mcp251xfd driver and marks some
instances of struct mcp251xfd_priv as const. Lad Prabhakar contributes
2 patches for the rcar_canfd driver, that add support for RZ/G2L
family.

The next 5 patches target the m_can/tcan45x5 driver. 2 are by me an
fix trivial checkpatch warnings. The remaining 3 patches are by Matt
Kline and improve the performance on the SPI based tcan4x5x chip by
batching FIFO reads and writes.

The last 7 patches are for the c_can driver. Dario Binacchi's patch
converts the DT bindings to yaml, 2 patches by me fix a typo and
rename a macro to properly represent the usage. The last 4 patches are
again by Dario Binacchi and provide a performance improvement for the
TX path by operating the TX mailboxes as a true FIFO.

regards,
Marc
