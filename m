Hi,

thanks for your patches :)

IMHO reyling on PHY_RST_AFTER_CLK_EN was broken since the day of adding
this feature because:

1st) Each host driver needs to call the phy-reset logic. So this isn't a
     fix for all hosts using a LAN8720 phy.
2st) It interacts realy bad with the phy state machine. Only the state
     machine should be able to do this.

Why can't you add the clock?

NACK, the clock provider can be any clock. This has nothing to do with
the FEC clocks. The FEC _can_ be used as clock provider.

You can't just turn off the clock for the LAN8720 because of the phy
internal state machine. The state machine gets confused if the clock is
turned off/on randomly.

IMHO pulling the reset line everytime has a few disadvantages:
 - You need to ensure that the strapping pins are correct and
 - You need to ensure that the reset logic including the reset delays
   are keeped.

IMHO NACK since this was the wrong approach.

All iMX machines are now DT-based why can't you just add the correct
clock provider?
