Flexibility is good for the time when very complicated or unusual flow 
handling is needed. OTOH, good flexibility often sacrifices good 
usability IMO. Configuration tends to be difficult.

What I want to do here is to make XDP easy for sysadmins for typical 
use-cases. u32 is good for flexibility, but to me flower is easier to 
use. Using flower fits better in my intention.

Userspace daemon is possible. Do you mean adding notification points in 
TC and listen filter modification events from userspace? If so, I'm not 
so positive about this, as it seems difficult to emulate TC/kernel 
behavior from userspace.
Note that I think u32 offload can be added in the future even with 
current xdp_flow implementation.
