I think there's a bug here which can lead to unlimited memory leak.
This should reproduce the bug:

    # mount -t cgroup -o netprio xxx /cgroup/netprio
    # mkdir /cgroup/netprio/xxx
    # echo PID > /cgroup/netprio/xxx/tasks
    /* this PID process starts to do some network thing and then exits */
    # rmdir /cgroup/netprio/xxx
    /* now this cgroup will never be freed */

Look at the code:

static inline void sock_update_netprioidx(struct sock_cgroup_data *skcd)
{
	...
	sock_cgroup_set_prioidx(skcd, task_netprioidx(current));
}

static inline void sock_cgroup_set_prioidx(struct sock_cgroup_data *skcd,
					u16 prioidx)
{
	...
	if (sock_cgroup_prioidx(&skcd_buf) == prioidx)
		return ;
	...
	skcd_buf.prioidx = prioidx;
	WRITE_ONCE(skcd->val, skcd_buf.val);
}

task_netprioidx() will be the cgrp id of xxx which is not 1, but
sock_cgroup_prioidx(&skcd_buf) is 1 because it thought it's in v2 mode.
Now we have a memory leak.

I think the eastest fix is to do the mode switch here:

diff --git a/net/core/netprio_cgroup.c b/net/core/netprio_cgroup.c
