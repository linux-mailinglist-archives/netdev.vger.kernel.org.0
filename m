Tom, 

I will not go into whether Tom or router vendors is right from IETF perspective as here is not the place to discuss. 

But it seems to me that the motivation behind these patches is just to pushback on the current IETF proposals. 

The patches timeline is completely aligned with when IETF threads get into tough discussions (May 2019, August 2019, and now). 

Iâ€™m not the one to decide, but IMO people should not add stuff to the kernel just to enforce their opinions on other mailers.
