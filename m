I guess, the other point here is that it's not an L4 hash either.

It's a random number.  So, the documentation will still not be
correct even after the change proposed in this patch.


One other solution to the problem might be to stop setting l4_hash
flag while it's a random number.

One way to not break everything doing that will be to introduce a
new flag, e.g. 'rnd_hash' that will be a hash that is "not related
to packet fields, but provides a uniform distribution over flows".

skb_get_hash() then may return the current hash if it's any of
l4, rnd or sw.  That should preserve the current logic across
the kernel code.
But having a new flag, we could introduce a new helper, for example
skb_get_stable_hash() or skb_get_hash_nonrandom() or something like
that, that will be equal to the current version of skb_get_hash(),
i.e. not take the random hash into account.

Affected subsystems (OVS, ECMP, SRv6) can be changed to use that
new function.  This way these subsystems will get a software hash
based on the real packet fields, if it was originally random.
This will also preserve ability to use hash provided by the HW,
since it is not normally random.

With that, we'll also not need to have in the API something that has
'L4' in the name and in the docs, but has no relation to packet fields.
It can be argued that the description in the doc doesn't mean that
this hash is computed using L4 packet fields, but it's confusing
regardless and getting overlooked while creating new code, as it
shown by the issues in multiple substystems.

Hope this makes some sense.


Dumitru also had some alternative ideas on how to provide a stable
hash to subsystems that need it, but I'll leave it to him.

Best regards, Ilya Maximets.
