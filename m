Hello Marc,

thanks for positive reply for our years effort.

Is this blocker for now? I would like to start with years tested base.

We have HW timestamping implemented for actual stable CTU CAN FD IP core 
version, support for variable number of TX buffers which count can be 
parameterized up to 8 in the prepared version and long term desire to 
configurable-SW defined multi-queue which our HW interface allows to 
dynamically server by รก TX buffers. But plan is to keep combinations
of the design and driver compatible from the actual revision.

I would be happy if we can agree on some base/minimal support and get
it into mainline and use it as base for the followup patch series.

I understand that I have sent code late for actual merge window,
but I am really loaded by teaching, related RISC-V simulator
https://github.com/cvut/qtrvsim , ESA and robotic projects
at company. So I would prefer to go step by step and cooperate
on updates and testing with my diploma students.

Hmm, when I have thought about that years ago I have not noticed real
difference when time quanta is move between PROP_SEG and PHASE_SEG1.
So for me it had no influence on the algorithm computation and
could be done on the chip level when minimal and maximal sum is
respected. But may it be I have overlooked something and there is
difference for CAN FD.  May it be my colleagues Jiri Novak and 
Ondrej Ille are more knowable.

As for the optimal timequantas per bit value, I agree that it
is not so simple. In the fact SJW and even tipple-sampling
should be defined in percentage of bit time and then all should
be optimized together and even combination with slight bitrate
error should be preferred against other exact matching when
there is significant difference in the other parameters values.

But I am not ready to dive into it till our ESA space NanoXplore
FPGA project passes final stage... 

By the way we have received report from Andrew Dennison about
successful integration of CTU CAN FD into Litex based RISC-V
system. Tested with the Linux our Linux kernel driver.

The first iteration there, but he reported that some corrections
from his actual development needs to be added to the public
repo still to be usable out of the box
