A bit to be absolutely honest. :D
But I was able to ignore this feature so far so it was not much of

Indeed, I was worried that you wouldn't be able to answer the second

Wow, I can't thank you enough for all the detailed explanations!
I've seen many small hints of this in various places but I could never
really understand how they all relate to each other.
This is much clearer now. :)

I'm pretty sure it's actively used now on typical USB modems based on
MDM9607. As far as I know that one has BAM-DMUX and "forwards" it via
USB (without NAT).

Hmm, is this "DS" on the modem something special I don't know about?
It sounds like the part of the modem that I talk to via QMI to establish
new connections. However, since QMI does not go through BAM-DMUX
(RPMSG/SMD or QRTR instead) there should be only very few packets sent
via BAM-DMUX during negotation of QMAP.

To be sure I just tried QMAP with my BAM-DMUX driver again. It's been
quite some time since I tried it and it turns out this causes even more
"brain damage" than I could even remember. :D For reference:

 1. First I need to set the modem to QMAP mode, this works e.g. with
    qmicli -pd /dev/wwan0qmi0 \
    --wda-set-data-format="link-layer-protocol=raw-ip,ul-protocol=qmap,dl-protocol=qmap,dl-datagram-max-size=4096"

    However, it's important that my BAM-DMUX driver OPENs the channel
    before doing this (together with announcing support for the "dynamic
    MTU" feature). Otherwise the modem hangs forever and stops responding
    to any QMI messages. This doesn't happen when switching to Raw-IP mode.

 2. With QMAP, the struct bam_dmux_hdr->len is always set to 0xffff (65535)
    instead of the actual packet length, which means my current driver
    just drops those packets ("Data larger than buffer? (65535 > 4088)").

    This is also handled in your commit (you get the size from the SPS
    driver instead), but the bam_dma driver in mainline currently does
    not have this feature. :/

 3. I sent some ping packets but never got the signal to "enable large
    MTU" from the modem. Something is still strange here. :/

Given all these complications (that are not present when ignoring QMAP)
I would generally agree with you that it's not worth supporting this:

> Since this not something an end user should ever exercise, you may want to
> consider dropping it.
> 

Personally, I have indeed no need for it. I just suspect someone might
want this eventually for one of the following two use cases:

  1. Multiplexing on new firmwares: AFAICT there is only one BAM-DMUX
     channel on recent firmware versions (e.g. MSM8937/MDM9607). In that
     case multiple connections are only possible through the multiplexing
     layer in QMAP. I've been told the multiplexing is actually useful and
     necessary in some cases (maybe it was for some MMS configurations,
     I don't remember exactly).

  2. USB tethering: I know some people are working on mainline Linux
     for some MDM9607-based USB modems and they will probably want the
     weird USB tethering feature at some point.

But all in all given all the trouble involved when making QMAP work
I think I will just ignore that feature for now and wait until someone
shows up who absolutely needs this feature...

Thanks again for all the explanations!
