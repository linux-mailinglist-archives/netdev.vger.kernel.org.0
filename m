FROM MR.BASHAM ZEBDANI
AUDIT& ACCOUNT MANAGER
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO
WEST AFRICA.

Dear Friend,

With due respect, I have decided to contact you on abusiness
transaction  that will be beneficial to both of us. At the bank last
account and  auditing evaluation, my staffs came across an old account
which was being maintained by a foreign client who we learn was among
the deceased passengers of motor accident on November.2003, the
deceased was unable to run this account since his death. Theaccount
has  remained dormant without the knowledge of his family since it was
put in a  safe deposit account in the bank for future investment by
the client.

Since his demise, even the members of his family haven't applied for
claims over this fund and it has been in the safe deposit account
until I discovered that it cannot be claimed since our client
isaforeign national and we are sure that he has no next of kin here to
file claims over the money. As the director of the department, this
discovery was brought to my office so as to decide what is to bedone.I
decided to seek ways through which to transfer this money out of the
bank and out of the country too.

The total amount in the account is USD $18.6 million with my positions
as staffs of the bank,I am handicapped because I cannot operate
foreign accounts and cannot lay bonafide claim over this money. The
client was a foreign  national and you will only be asked to act as
his next of kin and I will supply you with all the necessary
information and bank data to assist you in being able to transfer this
money to any bank of your  choice where this money could be
transferred into.The total sum will be shared as follows: 50% for me,
50% for you and expenses incidental occur  during the transfer will be
incur by both of us. The transfer is risk free on both sides hence you
are going to follow my instruction till the fund  transfer to your
account. Since I work in this bank that is why you should  be
confident in the success of this transaction because you will be
updated with information as at when desired.

I will wish you to keep this transaction secret and confidential as I
am hoping to retire with my share of this money at the end of
transaction  which will be when this money is safety in your account.I
will then come over to your country for sharing according to the
previously agreed percentages. You might even have to advise me on
possibilities of investment in your country or elsewhere of our
choice. May  God help you to help me to a restive retirement,Amen,And
You have to  contact me through my private e-mail
at(bashamzebdani@gmail.com)Please for further information and inquires
feel free to contact me back immediately for more explanation and
better understanding I want you to assure me your capability of
handling this  project with trust by providing me your following
information details such as:

(1)NAME..............
(2)AGE:................
(3)SEX:.....................
(4)PHONE NUMBER:.................
(5)OCCUPATION:.....................
(6)YOUR COUNTRY:.....................

Yours sincerely,
Mr.Basham Zebdani
