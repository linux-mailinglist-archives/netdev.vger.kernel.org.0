Yes.

That feels backwards to me; it centralizes a bunch of information about
distinct users to be able to shove that into a static array, when the callsites
can pass that information. 

What's *actually* common after separating out the ranges? Is it just the
permissions?

If we want this to be able to share allocations and so on, why can't we do this
like a kmem_cache, and have the callsite pass a pointer to the allocator data?
That would make it easy for callsites to share an allocator or use a distinct
one.

Mark.
