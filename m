Ok! Just so that I'm certain of your setup. You receive packets to an
i40e netdev where there's an XDP program. The program does XDP_PASS or
XDP_REDIRECT to e.g. devmap for non-vxlan packets. However, vxlan
packets are redirected to AF_XDP socket(s) in *copy-mode*. Am I
understanding that correct?

I'm assuming this is an x86-64 with 4k page size, right? :-) The page
flipping is a bit different if the PAGE_SIZE is not 4k.

Let's dig into your scenario.

Are you saying the following:

Page A:
+------------
| "first skb" ----> Rx HW ring entry X
+------------
| "second skb"----> Rx HW ring entry X+1 (or X+n)
+------------

This is a scenario that shouldn't be allowed, because there are now
two users of the page. If that's the case, the refcounting is
broken. Is that the case?

Check out i40e_can_reuse_rx_page(). The idea with page flipping/reuse
is that the page is only reused if there is only one user.

The data for the "first skb" resides on a page:
A:
+------------
| "first skb"
+------------
| to be reused
+------------
refcount >>1

 >         2. seconds skb is for xsk, copy data to xsk memory, and page

Note that page B != page A.

B:
+------------
| to be reused/or used by the stack
+------------
| "second skb for xsk"
+------------
refcount >>1

data is copied to socket, page_frag_free() is called, and the page
count is decreased. The driver will then check if the page can be
reused. If not, it's freed to the page allocator.

I'm having trouble grasping how this is possible. More than one user
implies that it wont be reused. If this is possible, the
recounting/reuse mechanism is broken, and that is what should be
fixed.

The AF_XDP redirect should not have semantics different from, say,
devmap redirect. It's just that the page_frag_free() is called earlier
for AF_XDP, instead of from i40e_clean_tx_irq() as the case for
devmap/XDP_TX.

I have only addressed non-zerocopy, so we're on the same page (pun
intended) here!
