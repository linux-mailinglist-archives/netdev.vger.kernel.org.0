Sure, no problem.

Makes sense, but if NF_STOLEN gets returned the skb is already released,
so we can't touch it anymore.

We could emulate NF_STOLEN via ACT_STOLEN, yes, but we'd have to
skb_clone() unconditionally for every skb before calling the target
eval function...

Other alternatives I can think of:

- keep a list of "known safe" targets,
- annotate all accept-or-drop targets as "safe for act_ipt"
- make the skb shared before calling target function
- ensure that targets will never ever return NF_STOLEN

I dont really like any of these options :-)

At this time, targets return one of accept/drop/queue.

NF_QEUEUE will log an error and treats it like NF_ACCEPT,
so we are good at this time.
