Hi Sachin,

It seems the kernel finishes its job immediately but userspace takes more
time on retrying or something.  The service_start_timeout seems to be the
timeout period.

I think this message comes from here.
https://github.com/freedesktop/libfprint-fprintd/blob/master/src/main.c#L183-L189

I'm not sure what the program does though, I guess it failed to find a peer
socket in the hash table while calling connect()/sendmsg() syscalls and got
-ECONNREFUSED in unix_find_bsd() or unix_find_abstract().

Before the commit, all of sockets on the host are linked in a global hash
table, and after the commit, they are linked in their network namespace's
hash table.  So, I believe there is no change visible to userspace.

* Could you provide
  * dmesg and /var/log/messages on a successful case? (without the commit)
  * Unit file
  * repro steps

* Is it reproducible after login? (e.g. systemctl restart)
  * If so, please provide
    * the result of strace -t -ff

* Does it happen on only powerpc? How about x86 or arm64?

* What does the service does?
  * connect() or sendmsg()
  * protocol family
  * abstract or BSD socket

Best regards,
Kuniyuki
