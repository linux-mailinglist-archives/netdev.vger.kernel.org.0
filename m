I am Mr. Matt Hubbard, an Accountant with Lloyds Bank and am the
personal Account Manager to Late Mr. Theodoros Angelopoulos.


Theodoros Angelopoulos (Herein after shall be referred to as my
client), died late on Tuesday, 24 January 2012, several hours after
being involved in an accident while shooting his latest film. Theo
Angelopoulos the filmmaker had been with his crew in the area of
Drapetsona, Piraeus Greece when he was hit by a motorcycle driven by
an off-duty police officer. Unfortunately he lost his life in the
event of the accident, since then I have made several inquiries to
locate any of his extended relatives, this has also proved
unsuccessful. After these several Unsuccessful attempts, I decided to
trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of His
family but of no avail, hence I contacted you to stand as his next of
kin.


I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money in addition,
property left behind by my client before they got Confiscated or
declared non-serviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were
lodged. Particularly, Lloyds Bank, where the deceased had an account
valued at about Nine Million Great British Pounds. Consequently, the
bank issued me a notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account
confiscated within the next twenty official working days.


Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 5
years now, I hereby seek your consent to present you as the next of
kin to the deceased based on the fact that you are a foreigner so that
the proceeds of this account valued at about Nine Million Great
British Pounds can be paid to you and then you and I can share the
money. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% shall be for expenses or
tax as your government may require. An attorney shall be contracted to
help re-validate and notarize all the necessary legal documents that
can be used to back up any claim we make. All I require is your honest
cooperation to enable us sees this deal through. I guarantee that this
will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you
from any breach of the law.


To enable us discuss further, I want you to email me the following
information so I can open up a next of kin file on your behalf here in
the bank.
