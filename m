Thanks for the report. XID 641 is CFG_METHOD_5 = RTL8125B in the r8125 vendor driver.
This new chip version isn't supported yet by the r8169 driver. Typically I wait for
reports like yours because:
- Not every chip version in the vendor driver makes it to the market.
  Adding support for it would be wasted effort.
- I don't have hardware for testing. I need users like you for it ..

This may or may not work, partially also depending on the link partner. Typically each
chip version needs it own quirks, therefore they are treated differently by the vendor driver.

There is not really something to debug. I have to port all chip quirks from
the vendor driver and ask Realtek for a firmware file.
I'll put it on my roadmap, maybe it makes it into 5.9 or 5.10. Until then
you would have to use vendor driver r8125.
