Hi, all

I have noticed that there may be some difficulties in the advancement of this series of patches.
I guess the main problem is to try remove the global lock in this patch, the risks of removing locks
do harm to SMC-D, at the same time, this patch of removing locks is also a little too complex.

So, I am considering that we can temporarily delay the advancement of this patch. We can works on
other patches first. Other patches are either simple enough or have no obvious impact on SMC-D.

What do you think?

Best wishes.
D. Wythe
