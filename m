 both wife Nera Mubarak, and daughter Fatimata Mubarak.

 You are required to contact me immediately to enable me update you in
 detail's about the process of this very golden opportunity. I urge you to
 call or mail me immediately for further details bearing in mind that the
 Bank has given us a date limit, please act fast. I await your urgent
 response.
