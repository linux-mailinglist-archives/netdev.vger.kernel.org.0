The function may be changed by the user. Then what? Rename the LED device?
A typical use case is also that one LED indicates both, link and activity.

This leads to new questions like: How do you know what the possible
link modes are? In a spare minute you could have a look at enum
ethtool_link_mode_bit_indices. Even with standard multi-gig hw
meanwhile you have: 10M, 100M, 1G, 2.5G, 5G, 10G.
Supposedly the information about possible link modes would have to be
stored in led_classdev so that it can generate the appropriate sysfs
directories during registration.

For a fully hw-offloaded LED like in my case then more or less the only
benefit of led_classdev + netdev trigger is the unified location of
link speed + tx/rx attributes. The brightness attribute has no meaning
because brightness can't be controlled.
Overall quite some overhead for a small functionality. At least in a
simple case like mine I'd use custom attributes under the net_dev like
this if I had to invent something on my own:
led0/speed: where you can say: "echo +100 > led0/speed" to enable 100M link indication
led0/activity: bool

I don't want to be the one always saying: Nice framework, but heh:
How about my special case xyz?

I understand that it can be a frustrating job, that needs quite some
patience, to create a framework that you consider to be clean and
that covers the needs of (almost) everybody. I failed with some early
attempts to establish RGB LED support using the HSV color model.
