Ouagadougou - Burkina Faso.

Dear friend, Good Day

I am writing to seek your cooperation over this business, Please due
welcome this letter.

I am Mr Janvier Litse.the director of the accounts & auditing dept .at
the African Development Bank Ouagadougou-west Africa (A D B) With due
respect, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that
will be beneficial to both of us.At the bank's lastaccounts/auditing
evaluations, my staffs came across an old account which was being
maintained by a foreign client who we learnt was among the deceased
passengers of motor accident on November.. 2003, the deceased was
unable to run this account since his death. The account has remained
dormant without the knowledge of his family since it was put in a safe
deposit account in the bank for future investment by the client.

Since his demise, even the members of his family haven't applied for
claims over this fund and it has been in the safe deposit accountuntil
I discovered that it cannot be claimed since our client is a foreign
national and we are sure that he has no next of kin here to file
claims over the money. As the director of the department, this
discovery was brought to my office so as to decide what is to be done.
I decided to seek ways through which to transfer this money out of the
bank and out of the country too.

The total amount in the account is twenty eight  million three hundred
thousand dollars (USD 28,300,000.00).with my positions as a staffs of
the bank, I am handicapped because I can not operate foreign accounts
and cannot lay bonafide claim over this money.The client was a foreign
national and you will only be asked to act as his next of kin and I
will supply you with all the necessary information and bank data to
assist you in being able to transfer this money to any bank of your
choice where this money could be transferred into.

The total sum will be shared as follows: 50% for me, 50% for you and
expenses incidental occur during the transfer will be  incured by both
of us. The transfer is risk free on both sides hence you are going to
follow my instruction till the fund transfer to your account.

Since I work in this bank that is why you should be confident in the
success of this transaction because you will be updated with
information as at when desired I will wish you to keep this
transaction secret and confidential as I am hoping to retire with my
share of this money at the end of transaction which will be when this
money is safety in your account. I will then come over to your country
for sharing according to the previously agreed percentages. You might
even have to advise me on possibilities of investment in your country
or elsewhere of our choice. May God help you to help me to a restive
retirement, Amen.


Please for further information and enquires feel free to contact me
back immediately for more explanation and better  understanding.please
contact me through this alternative email address
(janvierlitse2019@gmail.com)

I am waiting for your urgent response!!!
Thanks and remain blessed
 Mr Janvier Litse.
