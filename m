I think the datasheets are the source of the confusion. If the
datasheets for different chips list 0x0022155x as PHYID each, and
authors of support for additional chips don't check the existing code,
then happens what happened.
However it's not a rare exception and not Microchip-specific that
sometimes vendors use the same PHYID for different chips.

And it seems you even missed one: KSZ8795
It's a switch and the internal PHY's have id 0x00221550.

If the drivers for the respective chips are actually different then we
may change the driver to match the exact model number only.
However, if there should be a PHY with e.g. id 0x00221554 out there,
it wouldn't be supported any longer and the generic PHY driver would
be used (what may work or not).

Obviously best would be get some input from Microchip.
