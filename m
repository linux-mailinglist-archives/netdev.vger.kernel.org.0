From one side it will definitely help to see old code, but from another
it will create many ifdef inside of the code with a very little chance
of testing. Also we will continue to have the same problem to decide when
we can delete this code.

What about if we introduce one ifdef, let's say CONFIG_INFINIBAND_LEGACY
and put everything that will be declared as legacy to that bucket? And
once every 5 (???) years delete everything from that bucket.
