I mean my first thought seeing an ioctl on a socket that gives an explicit channel and then receives 
crap from other channels on the same socket was "wtf" so I went and read the kernel to figure out 
why first to see if its a driver bug. I can't seem to find *any* documentation for how these ioctls 
are supposed to work, but it seems the "request" here is kinda misnomer, its really a "configure 
hardware" request, and is unrelated to future reads on the socket, or really the specific socket at all.

As for duplicating the output across sockets, ptp_chardev.c's `ptp_read` is pretty trivial - just 
pop the next sample off the queue and return it. Tweaking that to copy the sample into every reader 
is probably above my paygrade (and has a whole host of leak risk I'd probably screw up). 
`extts_fifo_show` appears to be functionally identical.

I've CC'd the MAINTAINERs for ptp to see what they think about this, though it won't let chrony 
support this without a kernel upgrade - not sure if that's an issue for chrony or not.

Matt
