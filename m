Yes, that would be my preference. Always return @peerid
for DONE if the TLS session was established.
We might also consider returning @peerid with EACCESS
to indicate the offending ID.

Yes, it is.

So the only bone of contention is the timeout; as we won't
be implementing signals I still think that we should have
a 'timeout' attribute. And if only to feed the TLS timeout
parameter for gnutls ...
