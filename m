This one I agree could well be the culpret, but it means that the
original premise that PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_INTERNAL was being used is
incorrect - it's actually been relying on using PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_NA.

It instead means that PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_NA was being used, which
really isn't good, because PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_NA internally inside
phylink has always had a special meaning - that being with the
validate step which has been used to get _all_ possible modes from
the MAC. This was never intended to be used for anything except
phylink's internal use to retrieve that information from the MAC
driver to make decisions about what mode(s) a SFP should use.

So yes, this is most likely the culpret, and if proven, please use
it for the Fixes: tag for any fixes to drivers that incorrectly
relied upon that behaviour.

Thanks.
