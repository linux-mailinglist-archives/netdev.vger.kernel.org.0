Hello Dear, (webmyprivate2019@webmail.co.za), 
(annacooper2019@yandex.com)

I am Mrs. Anna Cooper, from Australia, lived in South Africa for 20years 
and currently residing in London United Kingdom, a widow to late Dr. 
Andrew Cooper. I am 78 years old and presently suffering from Leukemia.

My health condition has gotten worse and just two weeks ago my doctor 
informed me that my condition has reach a critical stage, and that I 
have just 3 months left. This confirmation from my doctor was and still 
is devastating news; it is hard to know that you have just a little time 
left to live here.

My late husband was a contractor in both South Africa and London, he 
died in a plane crash and during the period of our marriage we could not 
bear any child. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I 
inherited all his businesses and wealth both in South Africa and 
London-United Kingdom.

After the doctor's medical pronunciation that I have just few months to 
live, I decided to divide my wealth to contribute to your country and 
Africa where my late husband as a contractor made lots of money. I want 
to assist you with the funds to do great charity works in your country, 
this is my last wish. I selected you after searching few websites; I 
prayed and was led to you. I am willing to donate the sum of Four 
Million, Six Hundred thousand United States Dollars (USD$4,600,000.00) 
to the less privileged through you.

Please I want to transfer this money to you as I am travelling to South 
Africa soonest to have my lawyer amend my WILL. If you can handle this 
fund and very sure to do charity works on my behalf then I will include 
your name in my WILL when in South Africa, and from there I will travel 
to Australia to meet a specialist as I want to be buried alongside my 
late husband when I passed on. Note that this fund is in the financial 
institution and upon my instruction; I will file in an application 
through my family attorney for the transfer of the money into your 
account for the said purpose.

Lastly, I honestly pray that this money when transferred will be used 
for the said purpose even though I might be late then. I have come to 
find out that wealth is vanity and I made a promise to God that my 
wealth will be used to support the poor and the assist the sick. Do let 
me know if you will be able to handle this fund and use it for the said 
purpose so that I will inform my attorney and my bank on my decision.

God bless you
