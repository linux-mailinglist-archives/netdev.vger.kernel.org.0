So in general we certainly agree that you should never expose someone
that you wouldn't trust with root on the host to syscall interception
mounting of real kernel filesystems.

But that's not all that our syscall interception logic can do. We have
support for rewriting a normal filesystem mount attempt to instead use
an available FUSE implementation. As far as the user is concerned,
they ran "mount /dev/sdaX /mnt" and got that ext4 filesystem mounted
on /mnt as requested, except that the container manager intercepted
the mount attempt and instead spawned fuse2fs for that mount. This
requires absolutely no change to the software the user is running.

loopfs, with that interception mode, will let us also handle all cases
where a loop would be used, similarly without needing any change to
the software being run. If a piece of software calls the command
"mount -o loop blah.img /mnt", the "mount" command will setup a loop
device as it normally would (doing so through loopfs) and then will
call the "mount" syscall, which will get intercepted and redirected to
a FUSE implementation if so configured, resulting in the expected
filesystem being mounted for the user.

LXD with syscall interception offers both straight up privileged
mounting using the kernel fs or using a FUSE based implementation.
This is configurable on a per-filesystem and per-container basis.

I hope that clarifies what we're doing here :)
