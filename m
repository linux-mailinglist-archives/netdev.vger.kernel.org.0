Greetings Dearest Beloved,

I know that this letter may be a very big surprise to you, I came
across your email contact from my personal search and I instructed the
doctor here in this hospital to help me email you and i believe that
you will be honest to fulfill my final wish before i will give up.

I am Mrs.Mariam Mussa , I am 66 years old,From Solomon Islands, and I
am suffering from a long time cancer of the breast. From all
indication my condition is really deteriorating,and my doctors have
courageously advised me that I may not live beyond the next three
months, this is because the cancer has reached a critical stage.

I was married to late Dr. Anthony Spagnolo, a contractor with UNITED
NATIONS in Burkina Faso, West Africa, where we live all our Lives for
Thirty-two years before he died. But is quite unfortunately, He died
after a Cardiac Arteries Operation that lasted only for four days.

Since his death I decided not to re-marry, I sold all my inherited
belongings and deposited all the sum of $8.2million dollars with a
Bank in Ouagadougou- Burkina Faso, where we spend our life together
with United Nations as contractor.

Presently,this money is still in their custody, and the management
just wrote me as the Legitimate beneficiary to come forward to receive
the money after keeping it for so long or rather issue a letter of
authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf since I cannot
come over as a result of my illness, or they get it confiscated.

It is my last wish to see that this money is invested in any
organization of your choice and distributed each among the charity
organization, the poor and the motherless baby's home where I come
from.

I want your good humanitarian, to also use this money to fund
churches,orphanages and widows around. I must let you know that this
was a very hard decision, but I had to take a bold step towards this
issue because I have no further option. I hope you will help see my
last wishes come true.

l took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit
this money and my husband relatives are very devilish not even good at
all because they are the one that responsible for the death of my
husband in other to have all my late husband properties and I don't
want my husband's efforts to be used by those that conspired for his
death.

I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my
health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.
I don't want them to know about This development and I know that With
God all things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the Details.

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.
Hope to hear from you soonest.

Thanks and Remain blessed in the Lord.
Yours Sister in Christ,
Mrs.Mariam Mussa .
