Let's leave it for a future optimization.
I am not sure if there is use case to support both frag page and non-frag
page for the same page pool. If there is, maybe we can use "page->pp_frag_count
> 0" to indicate that the page is frag page, and "page->pp_frag_count == 0"
to indicate that the page is non-frag page, so that we can support frag page and
non-frag page for the same page pool instead of disabling non-frag page support
when PP_FLAG_PAGE_FRAG flag is set, which might be conflit with the above
optimization?


Also, I am prototyping the tx recycling based on page pool in order to see
if there is any value supporting the tx recycling.
As the busypoll has enable the one-to-one relation between NAPI and sock,
and there is one-to-one relation between NAPI and page pool, perhaps it make
senses that we use page pool to recycle the tx page too?

There are possibly below problems when doing that as I am aware of now:
1. busypoll is for rx, and tx may not be using the same queue as rx even if
   there are *technically* the same flowï¼Œ so I am not sure it is ok to use
   busypoll infrastructure to get the page pool ptr for a specific sock.

2. There may be multi socks using the same page pool ptr to allocate page for
   multi flow, so we can not assume the same NAPI polling protection as rx,
   which might mean we can only use the recyclable page from pool->ring under the
   r->consumer_lock protection.

3. Right now tcp_sendmsg_locked() use sk_page_frag_refill() to refill the page
   frag for tcp xmit, when implementing a similar sk_page_pool_frag_refill()
   based on page pool, I found that tcp coalesce in tcp_mtu_probe() and
   tcp fragment in tso_fragment() might mess with the page_ref_count directly.

As the above the problem I am aware of(I believe there are other problems I am not
aware of yet), I am not sure if the tcp tx page recycling based on page pool is
doable or not, I would like to hear about your opinion about tcp tx recycling support
based on page pool first, in case it is a dead end to support that.
