Oh, I checked IEEE 8021AX, this is only one paragraph mentioned PTP

8. Frame distribution and collection algorithms
8.2 Per-service frame distribution
8.2.1 Goals and objectives
Distributing frames to physical links by service ID, as defined in 8.2,
provides the following:

b) Bidirectional congruity: Providing a means for the two ends of an Aggregation Group to use the
same physical link in both directions for a given service ensures that a failed link or a link
experiencing an excessive error rate will affect the fewest possible number of services and in general
provide support for protocols that have strict symmetry requirements on their transmit and receive
paths, e.g., Precision Time Protocol (PTP) in IEEE Std 1588 â„¢ -2008.

But I didn't find any valuable information from it.

This is a RFE, I don't think this patch will affect the current user space as
the new topology is not supported before. i.e. no user space tool will configure
PTP based on bond or vlan over bond. And even the user space use other ways to
get bond's active interface, e.g. via netlink message. It still not affected
and could keep using the old way. So I think this patch should be safe.

Did I miss any thing?

Currently, I send RTM_GETLINK message on bond and listening on
RTM_NEWLINK message to get IFLA_LINKINFO info.

But for the new VLAN over bond topology. I haven't figure out a good solution.
Maybe I can just check the active interface status. When it get down,
do get_ts_info once again to get the new active interface on the VLAN over
bond interface. I need some testing.
