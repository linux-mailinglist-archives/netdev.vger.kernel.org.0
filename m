Applied. Thanks.

Looking at the tests that do mkstemp()+write() just to pass a file path
as .kconfig_path option into bpf_object_open_opts() it feels that file only
support for externs is unnecessary limiting. I think it will simplify
tests and will make the whole extern support more flexible if in addition to
kconfig_path bpf_object_open_opts() would support in-memory configuration.
