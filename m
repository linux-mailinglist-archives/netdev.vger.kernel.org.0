Oh, maybe I should be blunt here. This is the first time that I
got proper mii values for this RTL8363. This is revevant, because
in u-boot the vendor (Netgear) usually takes care of the "mii" tool.

But this wasn't the case here, I'm not sure if this RTL8363SB is
an odd-ball or not. This patch was meant for discussion, if the
discussion is fruitful, I fully expect to do a v2..v3 with the
information that was gathered during review.

Oh, I overwrote the current rtl8365mb_dsa_phy_write and
rtl8365mb_mdio_phy_read to match what's I found in ASUS WRT's codebase.
 From what I gathered, this mdc-mdio was tested/developped with an RT-AC88U.
So I think you all are no stranger to the ASUSWRT Merlin Project @
https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net/. Thankfully they have a link to their
github and provide the realtek source code which includes the phy
access routines in:

https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng/blob/master/release/src-rt-6.x.4708/linux/linux-2.6.36/drivers/char/rtl8365mb/rtl8367c_asicdrv_phy.c

as rtl8367c_setAsicPHYReg and rtl8367c_getAsicPHYReg. (look in line 21 for
the #if defined(MDC_MDIO_OPERATION) until the #else 188). These two are
what I implemented in rtl8365mb_mdio_phy_write and rtl8365mb_mdio_phy_read.

True :) and it was a pain to format. Still I'm hoping to get confirmation
about 0x001cc980-ish PHYID. This is something all switches should produce and
this should be repoduceable by others (with slightly different IDs).

Yes, I'm fully expecting these comments.

There are sadly the only useful comment in the vendor driver is "Default OCP Address"
with the associated 0x29 "Magic value". This 0x29 becomes 0xA400 if you put it through
the FIELD_PREP... And funnily enough, that exactly matches the existing
"RTL8365MB_PHY_OCP_ADDR_PHYREG_BASE" which is used by the current accessors (but they
do much much more).

It looks like the person that wrote the rtl8365mb_phy_ocp_read and
rtl8365mb_phy_ocp_write() could answer in detail what's behind this.
I'm sure this would be on a datasheet, but sadly I don't have one for the switch.

Oh, this is no longer the case. I have it sort of working now. The "no traffic"
issue was "fixed" by the second patch
"net: dsa: realtek: rtl8365mb: add missing case for digital interface 0".

Though, It's not 100% finished. "Normal data" works, but it seems the switch
doesn't like that I have multiple other VLANs on the same network (including
non-vlan traffic). I see a constant stream of "non-realtek ethertype ..."
message from tag_rtl8_4.c. These include 802.1Q (0x8100) EtherTypes,
IPv4 (0x0800) and IPv6 (86DD)). Though, I'm optimistic that this can be solved.

Yes, the provided jam_tables are enough to get the switch "online".
Thing is, I tried openwrt's rtl8367b.c tables too. But didn't notice any
difference. (The WNDAP660 isn't capable of "saturating" the 1 Gbit/s.
So, it's unlikely that I can trigger any performance related bugs by
simply flooding it.
