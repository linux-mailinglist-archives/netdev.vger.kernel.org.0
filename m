I just realized we need a bit more context here.  It started being a
visible problem after 265f94ff54d6 ("net: Recompute sk_txhash on
negative routing advice") and also after 3acf3ec3f4b0 ("tcp: Change
txhash on every SYN and RTO retransmit") when retransmits started
changing the txhash and implicitly the hash used by OvS.

What I had in mind is not really a stable hash but a "good enough
alternative".  It's probably "good enough" (at least for OvS/OVN) if the
hash used by OvS doesn't change throughout the lifetime of a TCP session.

Would it be possible to save the original (random) hash that was
generated for a locally terminated TCP session?  E.g., a new field in
'struct sock'.  It would be in essence a random tag associated to the
session that doesn't change throughout the lifetime of the session.
Unlike sk->sk_txhash which changes on retransmit/negative routing advice.

That means OvS doesn't have to compute a stable hash every time it
processes a packet,  It would just access this value through
skb->sk->good_name_for_this_new_tag.  The advantage is that it gives the
appearance of a canonical 4-tuple hash throughout the lifetime of a
session and it doesn't affect any of the use cases that required
877d1f6291f8 ("net: Set sk_txhash from a random number").

I probably missed relevant things but I thought it might be worth
sharing in case the idea has some value.
