For application point of view there won't be any difference.
kernel tls in tcp offload mode works exactly similar to software
kTLS.

We can consider adding the capability to working with established 
sockets.The TOE has not needed that capability to date since it can 
establish the socket itself, but it makes sense to provide uniformity 
with the kTLS approach so we will look into that.  For now, as you 
suggested replacing stack listen with toe listen makes more sense.

Itâ€™s been a slow process but with the new team it is picking up speed
and the quality of the code will continue to get better.
