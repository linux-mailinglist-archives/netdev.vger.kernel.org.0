Ok!

So should we completely skip hwmon_device_register_with_info() call
if (i2c_block_size < 2) ?

I do not think that manufacture says something. I think that they even
do not know that their Realtek chips are completely broken.

I can imagine that vendor just says: it is working in our branded boxes
with SFP cages and if it does not work in your kernel then problem is
with your custom kernel and we do not care about 3rd parties.
