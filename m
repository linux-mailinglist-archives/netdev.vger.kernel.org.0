 Great, thanks for checking!  And I note referring `__compile_error' is 
roughly equivalent to a dummy declaration, so you've got that part sorted.

 Yeah, dead code elimination is supposed to handle such cases.  The local
automatic variable is essentially a syntactic feature not to use the same 
expression inline over and over throughout a function (for clarity the 
variable should probably be declared `const', but that is not essential) 
and it is up to the compiler whether to reuse the value previously 
calculated or to re-evaluate the expression.

 Oh absolutely!  There's the slot-specific port I/O space that is used to 
identify EISA option cards in device discovery, so no EISA device will 
ever work without port I/O.  Have a look at `decode_eisa_sig' in 
drivers/eisa/eisa-bus.c for the very obvious code.  Note that some ISA 
cards can be configured to appear as EISA devices as well (I have a 3c509B 
Ethernet NIC set up that way).
