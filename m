Yes - there are four other PHYs on the bus, everything is attached to
the Lantiq Gigabit switch. I wasn't clear enough in this regard.

That sounds good.

A bit more info on the two-stage firmware upload: The Atheros SoC is a
complete AR9342 or QCA9558 SoC with 64MB or 128MB RAM. The stage 1
firmware only initializes the Ethernet connection and waits for the
stage 2 firmware. The latter consists in the vendor implementation of a
Linux kernel and minimal user space, the wireless cards are then somehow
"exported" over Ethernet to the Lantiq SoC. On the Lantiq, they look
like local Atheros interfaces  - it looks a lot like ath9k-htc with a
different transport

My current approach consists of a standalone Linux distribution (OpenWrt
based) that receives its configuration via Ethernet as stage 2 firmware.
This makes the second SoC quite capable.

To sum up: I've got two devices on one PCB where only one has access to
flash memory. The communication is entirely based on MDIO and Ethernet.

Andreas
