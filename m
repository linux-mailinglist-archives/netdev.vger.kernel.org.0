I donâ€™t have a super great feeling with this change.

So historically only hciconfig hci0 up/down was doing a power cycle of the controller and when adding the mgmt interface we moved that to the mgmt interface. In addition we added a special case of power up via hdev->setup. We never had an intention that the kernel otherwise can power up/down the controller as it pleases.

Can we ask Marvell first to investigate why this is fundamentally broken with their hardware? Since what you are proposing is a pretty heavy change that might has side affects. For example the state machine for the mgmt interface has no concept of a power down/up from the kernel. It is all triggered by bluetoothd.

I am careful here since the whole power up/down path is already complicated enough.

Regards

Marcel
