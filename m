I'm not sure I follow on this one: the former would still keep using the
bpf_trace_sd as-is today since only ever /one/ can be active on a given CPU
as we otherwise bail out in trace_call_bpf() due to bpf_prog_active counter.
Given these two are /not/ shared, you only need the code you have below for
nesting to deal with the raw_tps via get_bpf_raw_tp_regs() / put_bpf_raw_tp_regs()
which should also simplify the code quite a bit.

(See above wrt kprobes.)
