I agree, locking is not straight forward. But it's actually not that
complex:

- The MDIO bus lock is used for all TS/PHC register access.
- There is one lock for PHC operations and one for timestamping
  operations. The two are never used in the same function. We could use
  the same lock; introducing more waiting.
- There is one shared lock for GPIO operations. It is only used in
  PHC functions, in two places.

And I realized I can remove the locks from vsc8584_ptp_init, as PHC/TS
helpers are not registered until the PHY is initialized.

Thanks,
Antoine
