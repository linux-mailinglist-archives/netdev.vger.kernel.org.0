Why?  Just dump the whole thing in a drivers/staging/mtk/ directory
structure and all should be fine.

I do not know, let's see the code first.  But we can not add frameworks
with no in-kernel users, as that does not make any sense at all.

That is a Google requirement, not a kernel.org requirement.  Please work
with Google if you have questions/issues about that, there is NOTHING we
can do about that here in the community for obvious reasons.

As I stated before you need to have an in-kernel user for us to be able
to accept frameworks and functions into the tree.  Otherwise Linux would
quickly become unmanagable and unmaintainable.  Would you want to try to
maintain code with no in-tree users?  What would you do if you were in
our position?

But for networking flags like this that go into userspace, I do not know
what the maintainers of the networking stack require, so that really is
up to them, not me.
