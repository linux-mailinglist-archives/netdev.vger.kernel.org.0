I think so too. Will change it.

I don't expect this to work out of the box on ARM. To start with something
similar will be needed for ARM too.
We may still want to keep the driver code as-is.

I understand the concern here wrt ARM, however, currently the support is only
proposed for x86 guests here and similar work could be carried out for ARM.
Also, if regular hibernation works correctly on arm, then all is needed is to
fix Xen side of things.

I am not sure what could be done to achieve any assurances on arm side as far as
this series is concerned.
