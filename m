I wasn't talking about ethN being same as the network interface name.
For clarity I'll use ethernetN now. My question was why would you
use ethmacN or ethphyN instead if just ethernetN for both. What is
the reason for having two different names? I'm not sure who is using
that name anyway. If it is for an user, I don't think he is interested
in knowing wether that LED is controlled by the PHY or by the MAC.

But the first problem persists wether its named ethernetN or ethphyN,
no?
