This is the case that is a bit problematic with our hardware. (full taprio
offload + ETF offload).

It really depends on the workload, and how the schedule is organized,
but yeah, that might be possible (for some cases :-)).

That's true, mq and mqprio don't have enqueue()/dequeue(), but I think
that's more a detail of their implementation than a rule (that no
multiqueue-aware root qdisc should implement enqueue()/dequeue()).

That is, from my point of view, there's nothing wrong in having a root
qdisc that's also a shaper/scheduler.

I am wondering if there's a simpler solution, right now (as you pointed
out) taprio traverses all queues during dequeue(), that's the problem.

What I am thinking is if doing something like:

     sch->dev_queue - netdev_get_tx_queue(dev, 0);

To get the queue "index" and then only dequeuing packets for that queue,
would solve the issue. (A bit ugly, I know).

I just wanted to write the idea down to see if any one else could find
any big issues with it. I will try to play with it a bit, if no-one
beats me to it.
