thanks really, nice to know, i should not need
dynamic devicetree changes, but interesting that can be
done from u-boot this way.

I have a last issue, migrating from 5.4.70,
in 5.15.32 i have this error for both sfp cages:

# [   45.860784] mv88e6085 5b040000.ethernet-1:1d: p0: 
phylink_mac_link_state() failed: -95

[   49.093400] mv88e6085 5b040000.ethernet-1:1d: p1: 
phylink_mac_link_state() failed: -95


Is seems related to the fact that i am in in-band-status,
but 6321 has not serdes_pcs_get_state() op.

How can i fix this ?

Thanks !
