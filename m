Subject: [PATCH v2] dimlib: make DIMLIB a hidden symbol

According to Tal Gilboa the only benefit from DIM comes from a driver
that uses it. So it doesn't make sense to make this symbol user visible,
instead all drivers that use it should select it (as is already the case
AFAICT).

I thought it would be possible to git-apply my patch with the -3 option.
I even tested that, but obviously it only applies to my tree that has
the git object with the typo fixed. Sorry for the extra effort I'm
forcing on you. This patch applies to your public tree from just now.

Best regads
Uwe
