Yes, that's right. I had an early solution were I was sharing the GPIO
in the shared structure, allowing to have a single gpio_desc. (dt would
still needs to have one GPIO per PHY). That turned out to be a lot more
complex that the current solution, having to unregister and free the
GPIO desc manually when the driver of the last PHY was unregistered. I
had to add lots of logic (and not the nicely looking one) to the shared
PHY helpers in the core.

Right. I don't see a clean and nice way to do this. Do you have an idea?
On another hand, this would only lead to not being able to set/get (a
correct) time from the PHC.

Yes, I agree. That wasn't the design chosen when PHY packages were
added. This PHY already has a shared description, duplicated for each
PHY of the same package (for the interrupt line). If we were to change
this one day, we probably would have to break dt compatibility anyway as
there's already a property that is shared.

I think this kind of rework is out of this series scope; but I would be
happy to discuss a better solution for someday.

Thanks!
Antoine
