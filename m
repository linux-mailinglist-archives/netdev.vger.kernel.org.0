Initially this driver supported MMAP to allow user directly get the quote data
without internal copies. But it was later removed based on internal review
comments to simplify the driver interfaces. During the cleanup I somehow missed its
reference in Kconfig file. Sorry, I will fix it in next version.

Report data is copied by previous TDX module call. The pointer we pass to it is the
physical address of file->private_data.

We are trying to use the same buffer in both tdx_mcall_*() and tdx_hcall_*()
functions to avoid unnecessary data copies. Since we cannot pass decrypted page
address to TDX module call, we have decrypted it in IOCTL after doing the
TDX module call.

We can move this decrypted/encrypted mapping code to open()/close() functions.
But in that case, after the TDX module call, we need to separately copy the report
data to the quote buffer before making the GetQuote hypercall.

Same as above.

If you are fine with additional data copy cost, I can move the decrypted/
encrypted mapping code to open/close() functions.
