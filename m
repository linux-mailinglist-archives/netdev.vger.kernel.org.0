The psample module was first dependency that caught our attention. It is
here as an example of such not-needed dependency. Like Saeed said, we are
interested in more general solution that will allow us to use external
modules in fully dynamic mode.

Internally, as a preparation to the submission of mlx5 code that used nf_conntrack,
we found that restart of firewald service will bring down our mlx5_core driver, because
of such dependency.

So to answer on your question, HPC didn't complain yet, but we don't have any plans
to wait till they complain.

You are too focused on psample, while Saeed and I are saying more
general statement "I prefer to have 0 dependency on external modules in a HW driver."

This is another problem with mlx5 - complete madness with config options
that are not possible to test.
âžœ  kernel git:(rdma-next) grep -h "config MLX" drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/Kconfig | awk '{ print $2}' | sort |uniq |wc -l
19

And it is not weak dependency, but still hard dependency because you
need to recompile your kernel/module to disable/enable it. Any service
that will need to reload psample module for some reason will remove
mlx5_core.

Thanks
