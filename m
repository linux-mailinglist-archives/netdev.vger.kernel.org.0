Thanks for the explanation, I think it helps because the relationship
between wpan_dev and wpan_phy was not yet fully clear to me.

In order to clarify further your explanation and be sure that I
understand it the correct way, I tried to picture the above explanation
into a figure. Would you mind looking at it and tell me if something
does not fit?
