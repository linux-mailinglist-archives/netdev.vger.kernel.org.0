Well basically what this "vdev" is is the "port peer" we discussed
couple of months ago. It provides possibility for the user on bare metal
to cofigure things for the VF - for example.

Regarding hw_addr vs. port - it is not correct to make that a devlink
port attribute. It is not port's hw_addr, but the port's peer hw_addr.

Sure, it is a madeup name. If you have a better name, please share.
Basically it is something that represents VF/mdev - the other side of
devlink port. But in some cases, like NVMe, there is no associated
devlink port - that is why "devlink port peer" would not work here.

Yeah, I admit that the regions were probably step into wrong direction.
But only one driver (mlx4) implements and will be hopefully soon
coverted into health.

I'm worried about this too.

You are right, Documentation/ file is definitelly a good idea here.
