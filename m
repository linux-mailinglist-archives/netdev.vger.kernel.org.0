But the MII interface has by definition no tx clock? At the moment
tx_clk is set to the correct frequency for RGMII interfaces, right?
How would it break boards then?

And if you use tx_clk for like driving the PHY refclk input, that
would be an abuse of this clock (and shouldn't even work, because it
just sets the correct RGMII frequencies).

But then RGMII would be broken. Zynq and ZynqMP are the only users of
the tx_clk as far as I can see. There, it will set the clock generated
by the clock controller which is driving the TX_CLK for RGMII and the
corresponding input of the GEM/MACB.

I mean you have the same SoC, thus the same caps and usrio settings,
but you have two possible interfaces: MII and RGMII. (At least, because
there might also be other interfaces like GMII). Therefore, you cannot
check this bit, right? It will be the same for both MII and RGMII mode.

In any case, it should be correct to add MACB_CAPS_USRIO_DISABLED to
caps for the zynq family (I'd need to double check the ZynqMP RM).

Mh. If CLK_EN is supported this might be the case. Unfortunalty, Zynq
is the only user and doesn't have this bit.

PS. dont' get me wrong, I'm all for fixing this "the right way".
