That is my understanding as well. However I found this in the 802.1Q
and want to see if someone has insight into this parameter. So perhaps
we can ignore this for now and re-visit when there is a real need for
the same.

I think there is cycle time extension possible and in that case,
ConfigChangeTime may be different from Admin  base-time. So this gives
the actual time when the cycle configuration is actually applied.

Same here. Not sure how this will be used by application.

Ok. Hope you plan to send a patch for this in the future.

Ok.

To avoid duplicating the work if someone is already working on this.

Ok. Will keep in mind.
