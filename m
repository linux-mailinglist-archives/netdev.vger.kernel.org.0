This is a reminder for the Call for Proposals (CFP) for the Networking and
BPF track at the 2021 edition of the Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC), which
will be held virtually on the wider Internet, on September 20th - 24th, 2021.

This year's Networking and BPF track technical committee is comprised of:

   David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
   Jakub Kicinski <kuba@kernel.org>
   Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>
   Alexei Starovoitov <ast@kernel.org>
   Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>
   Andrii Nakryiko <andrii@kernel.org>

We are seeking proposals of 40 minutes in length (including Q&A discussion),
optionally accompanied by papers of 2 to 10 pages in length.

Any kind of advanced Linux networking and/or BPF related topic will be considered.

Please submit your proposals through the official LPC website at:

   https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/11/abstracts/

Make sure to select "Networking & BPF Summit" in the Track pull-down menu.

Proposals must be submitted by August 13th, and submitters will be notified of
acceptance by August 16th.

Final slides and papers (as PDF) are due on the first day of the conference.
