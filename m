[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggestions
to make it better, or if you want it re-generated with the latest status.]

Of the distinct crashes that syzbot has seen in the last week, I've manually
marked 8 of them as possibly being bugs in the "net/bpf" subsystem.  I've listed
these bug reports below.

Of these 8 reports, 1 was bisected to a commit from the following person:

	Alexei Starovoitov <ast@kernel.org>

I've manually checked that this bisection result looks plausible.

If you believe a bug report is no longer valid, please close it by sending a
'#syz fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the original
thread, as explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug report to the "net/bpf" subsystem, please
let me know and (if possible) forward it to the correct place.

Note: in total, I've actually assigned 42 open syzbot reports to this subsystem.
But to help focus people's efforts, I've only listed the 8 that have
(re-)occurred in the last week.  Let me know if you want the full list.

Here are the bug reports:
