I don't think reverting the commit is the best approach. Because this
will block adding any timestamp support to any of the existing PHYs.
Maybe a better solution is to enable or disable NETWORK_PHY_TIMESTAMPING
depending where you want to do the timestamp.

I don't have anything against having a whitelist the PHY driver names.

I was thinking about another scenario (I am sorry if this was already
discussed).
Currently when setting up to do the timestamp, the MAC will check if the
PHY has timestamping support if that is the case the PHY will do the
timestamping. So in case the switch was supposed to be a TC then we had
to make sure that the HW was setting up some rules not to forward PTP
frames by HW but to copy these frames to CPU.
With this new implementation, this would not be possible anymore as the
MAC will not be notified when doing the timestamping in the PHY.
Does it mean that now the switch should allocate these rules at start
time?
