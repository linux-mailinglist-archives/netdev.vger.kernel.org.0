I agree, it takes time to guess what the intention behind the wording
of the standard in some cases. I have the standard in front of me right
now and its 2163 pages... Even if I grep to IPV, the context is
overwhelmingly dense.

I'll try to ask around too, thanks for pointing this out. My best
understanding from the IPV that the standard treat it as skb->priority.
It defines IPV as a 32bit signed value, which clearly imply similar
semantics as skb->priority, which can be much larger than the number of
the queues or traffic classes.

Oh, alright. I continue to think about alternatives over introducing
new members into sk_buff. It would be very nice to have proper act_gate
IPV handling without hardware offload. Its great to see the support of
frame preemption and PSFP support in more and more hardware but on the
other hand it makes the lack of the proper software mode operation more
and more awkward.

Best,
