Not exporting thermal_zone_device_set_mode() implies not exporting
thermal_zone_device_enable()/thermal_zone_device_disable() because they
are implemented in terms of the former. Or do you have a different idea?

So we assume this: if a driver creates a tz which is initially ENABLED,
it will be polled. If a driver creates a tz which is initially DISABLED
(which is what you suggest the drivers should be doing, but not all of them
do), it won't be polled unless the driver explicitly enables its tz.

Am I concluding right that a suspended device will remain polled? Is it ok?

Ah, I guess now is the time to make the functions from patch 1 exported?

Ensuring no driver accesses tz->mode directly might be tricky, indeed.
If it can be shown that calling the update doesn't hurt a particular driver,
it can be converted to use the helpers instead of manipulating tz->mode
directly. If, however, it does make a difference then it all depends and
getting rid of accessing tz->mode directly might require help from the
respective maintainers.

This also calls for storing tz's mode in struct thermal_zone_device
rather than in individual drivers. In fact it seems the purpose
of ->get_mode() is to produce the state stored internally in drivers.
Removing ->get_mode() requires changing the place where the state is
stored. struct thermal_zone_device seems most appropriate. So this patch
is not going to be small.

Once we start storing tz's state in struct thermal_zone_device the
->set_mode() implementations need to be changed, too. To me it seems
awkward to split this change in two patches: if we keep the changes
split then in patch 4 we need to introduce code which implements
->set_mode() in terms of the new state location, only to remove it
in the very next patch.

While we are at it some drivers, namely acpi/thermal and int3400 store
their mode in an int rather than enum thermal_device_mode. So maybe
changing this should go even before patch 4? acerhdf does not store
its mode at all and on top of it it wants to manipulate the polling
delay directly and it has a module parameter which specifies it.

acerhdf wants ->set_mode() desperately.

Is it needed in drivers which create their thermal zone enabled?
