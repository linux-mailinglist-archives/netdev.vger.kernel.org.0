We are still working to send a patch for taprio offload on our hardware
and it may take a while to get to this. So if someone can help to add
the required kernel/driver interface for this, that will be great!

Looks like this is not an error per 802.1Q standard if I understood it
correctly.

This is what I see.
=======================================================================
 From 802.1Q 2018, 8.6.9.1.1 SetCycleStartTime()

If AdminBaseTime is set to the same time in the past in all bridges and
end stations, OperBaseTime is always in the past, and all cycles start
synchronized. Using AdminBaseTime in the past is appropriate when you
can start schedules prior to starting the application that uses the
schedules. Use of AdminBaseTime in the future is intended to change a
currently running schedule in all bridges and end stations to a new
schedule at a future time. Using AdminBaseTime in the future is
appropriate when schedules must be changed without stopping the
application

What I understand is that there will be some work done to allow auto
configuration of TSN nodes from user space and that would need access to
all or some of the above parameters along with tc command to configure
the same. May be a open source project for this or some custom
application? Any such projects existing??
