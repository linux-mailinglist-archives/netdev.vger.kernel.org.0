Yes, perhaps. I was thinking the details could be helpful but I can see 
how they might be perceived as vague and confusing. Maybe it would be 
better to just leave it at "The controller should be started in autobaud 
mode"?

CTS and RTS are actually used in the normal way during communication. 
The host will assert its RTS to indicate being ready to receive data 
from the controller. This flag just controls whether this happens before 
or after the controller is powered on. The controller will check the 
initial state of its BT_UART_CTS_N pin (connected to host's RTS) when 
starting up. It will enter autobaud mode if the signal is already asserted.
